 Enough poking, Varric.  Turning creepy loose on your stuff? Not a good idea, dwarfy.  Stop doing that.  I can hear how you’re looking at me. You’re doing that thing where you describe what we’re doing.  That’s a thing. Just stop it!  Oh sure, right? Happy as a pig in clover.  What?  Really? Eugh. Nature’s rubbish.  Alright, why “Buttercup”?  You don’t forget anything.  So why are you here? Slumming it with us lowlies? Get your fun that way?  Right. “Them”.  Dwarves are weird.  You’re doing this wrong!  I read one of your books, Varric.  Shut it. Anyway, it was boring. Your "adventures" are boring. I've seen way better just walking around.  Oh! Knitting is brilliant! It's stabby sewing!  Aren’t you supposed to tell fun stories? Why are they all so boring?  Why are you lot always on about this? There's no deal. You just do things.  Just things.  Nah, a friend shut them out. But they were legend, right?  They work. They’ve done more. This is just...what I do.  Oh yeah? Well, you don’t make sense either.  Your--shut it!  I’ve been lots of places.  Right, well, everyone knows an arse or two.  Well, hello third arse.  See? That’s how I know you’re not really one of us. You think like a noble.  You--what?  Bartered the keys and never even saw lordy. Half the fun, but that’s all right. Twice the take!  Yeah! A what?  Smarty-pants here really knows how to wring them out.  I’m buying you two crowns!  Do you think anyone heard?  I dunno why you’re so smug. I know way more people than you.  Pbblt! Winner over loser.  You’re not better than me, you know.  So what if you have "friends" who do shit for you and are "organized."  That problem you had down the Bannorn? Fixed it.  I’m still better at having chatty friends. Anyway, your caravan got away.  One angry cook and a side of bad pork. The shits stop a search as well as anything. Not every plan needs days and ropes and stuff.  (snorting laughter Yeah.  Who names their bow? It’s just a thing. That’s stupid.  Oh, kiss it already. And tell Booty, Coaty and...Other Booty, I’m real sorry.  That thing is too complicated. Lots to break.  That means you agree but don’t want her to know. But “she’s” just a thing!  Someone’s an arse. You. You’re an arse.  So Bianca? (giggles  That's what she said, probably. Because you two are friggin weird.  Why don't you have real Bianca instead of fingering your fake?  But you handle things. Secret network and all that.  Pity. Now I wonder how you two look naked.  What?  (sing-song La la la la la, Sentinals are shits.  Says the undwarfiest dwarf ever!  What sorts? What are you on about now?  She's human. Not whatever you said. Weirdy.  I think it bugs her that dwarves are so smooshy.  You? You’re just itchy. With your hair and...words.  Ugh. I get it, all right? You have better friends somewhere else.  All growly, never eye to eye. You miss people. Fine. Are you full-up or something?  Ugh, again with books. Get a ruddy shelf. You know, that holds more than one?  Piss off. Or thanks. Piss off!  I've heard things about you, Vivvy.  Yes, that’s what I heard. Not the title, the snotty bit.  You’re still doing it. Can you even shut it off?  Everyone look away. I need to find a place to pee.  Everyone look over here! Vivienne needs to pee!  Right, I bet you have plenty.  I know him! Pisshead's hard as ice with his people.  So, we hurt a real prick! But you swoop in? We help people, but it helps you more? (Frustrated growl.  Nothing!  Nowhere!  Hey Viv! Vivvy! Look at this! I've got something for you!  It's my butt!  They'll never really like you, Vivvy.  Those nobs in Orlais. They barely like their own kin. And you're a mage.  Well, halfway there, then.  I know, right? You people are weird.  What, you think you’re better than me?  Pretty sure she thinks she’s better than me.  (Coughs Who's a bitch?  Fact.  I sent a box of rabbit raisins to some Lord What's-his-tits in your name.  Ewww! Ew, ewww!  That's lies, right? Must be lies.  Enjoying your food lately, Vivvy?  Of course not, I would never. But you can't know, right?  Varri-- MINE!  Cruel bunch, your lot, Vivvy. Don't know how you live with what they think of you.  I don't give a squirt what anyone says.  No one wants to join your stupid club!  I bet you left a trail.  What you used to be. Wherever you're from. Little people will know about you.  She's frigging evil, she is.  You're not so scary, Vivvy. Maybe I can't bug you, but you can't bug me neither.  Yes you have.  You ruddy well tried, and it hasn't friggin worked! Got it?  I don't... I don't know what you're on about.  Joke's on you, I only had one key.  Took your knickers, Vivvy  Well that's... you're not doing this right!  Checked your drawers recently, Vivvy?  Sent... sent it back?  That's not... you're making fun, right?  (Shudders. Frigging stop it, witchy pisser!  A golden shitter. Their servants come down the streets to drink the abuse away. You can have it.  You all think no one can touch you, but I say a kind word to a butler and I'm in your vault. Because he hates you.  Yes, well, everyone says you're fat.  Some people saw spiders in there, I thought they'd be useful.  You don't need to be afraid of spiders to not want them in your smallclothes.  Ew, you're just not right.  (Chuckles Oh yes, please, run your mouth.  No, no, go on and on about how I'm not good enough, even though she makes me happy and it has piss all to do with you. And then when you're all smug and done I'll show you how my boot learned to shut a mouth in a Denerim alley.  On this, try me.  Fine. That's right, conversation over because it better be.  You're both nutters.  Stop it!  Two of you doesn't make this normal!  You can make magic anywhere, Solas? Ever piss it by accident?  What? How would you not remember something like that?  Hey, Solas! Droopy-ears-says-what?  Ugh, you're no fun!  Ugh, too winchy.  Pppbbthh!  Excuse yourself, whatever you said and what I did, same difference to me.  Uh huh? Know what else is good? Words that mean things. Like these. Words.  Pppbbthh.  Get off?  What? Don't make me think about that. I have to sleep at night!  Right, you're messing with me on purpose!  Heh. Fair point! That was pretty good.  Pfft, you say that everywhere.  I bet, right? Who wants to think about stepping on dead elves.  Oh, you felt that one.  (shivers Weird.  Ugh, here we go. It’s nothing, it just feels like I've seen this. Exactly this. It happens.  It’s not an elf thing. Inquisitor's not shaking.  It’s not an elf thing. You’re not shaking.  I suppose now you’ll switch to how I’m the same but different?  Well I’ve definitely heard piss like this before. Hmph!  Hang on.  You know, blue mostly. Except for the Breachy bits.  Greenish? Then clear a long ways, and kind of... felt like falling.  Ugh! Makes my head hurt. You make my head hurt.  We will be.  You were doing it too slow.  You're not making it worse. It's bad enough you people do that at all!  Is this a trick?  Where d'you get all this, then?  I don't know. Neither?  Oh, this again. All right, what am I doing?  What? Why? What ugly work?  None of it! I don't want any of that!  Nobles get rattled, and people get payback. I play in the middle.  What, just lop off the top? What's that do, except make a new top to frig it all up?  You hurt my head sometimes, Solas.  So, you and the Lady Inquisitor. Interesting.  That's all right, because I meant boring. The elf always takes the elf so that banging bits will mean something.  Oh, come on. Drop 'em and rebuild the empire. Phwoar!  What? Nothing? Like I thought, no fun.  Hmph! Fine. Whatever.  Not me. It's him! And you.  Oh, go twang your ears!  (Belches, then laughs. Hey Solas, how do you say "excuse me" in elven or whatever?  Thanks. Now when I don't say it, you'll know it's on purpose.  Don't you start.  Don't have to. You're all fluttery from that Mythal place.  "Oh, Tevinter took our stuff," except turns out, elves did it themselves. Ppbth!  Oh? Why's that?  Well, you just... Shut it!  Think I could find some Sentinel breeches?  So I could wear history. On my butt. Butt history. (Laughs.  Who said I was?  Ooooh! You think the only reason I'm not elfy is because I had no choice? Poor me, right?  Well, I've seen. I know. "Elven life" is backwards and boring.  Well you go "sustain" yourself. It sure doesn't sound like living.  Look at you, all serious. What do Wardens do when there's no Blight anyway?  Like join Inquisitions.  (Laughs. The Inquisition can't be all broody beards like you and Cassandra.  Oh, I'd bet she does. Places.  Knew it!  The kitchen wouldn't give me cakes because Josie, oh so prim, was sending them to allies.  (Laughs.  (Laughs. "Box of dog shit." That's a good one.  So, I've been thinking--No jokes, the lot of you--I thought Josie was kissing ass, getting right up in there. But she's actually been fooling nobs all along. Good, too.  All smiles and pleases, like giving us their stuff does them a favor twice over. And they love her for it! Best idea ever. I'll have to steal that one.  Still on about "Milady Josie" and her tricky tongue, and I've been thinking again. Shut up.  Here's how I'll do it too. I find a nob, right? And I seduce him--  Wait! Not done yet! He thinks he's being seduced, but when it's time for slap-and-tickle, I jump up and say...  "I like your wife better!" (Laughs.  He thinks he's in charge, but he isn't! I am!  Then I'll punch him, to make sure he gets it!  So. You gonna squeeze up to her or not?  Lady Josie. I've seen you, doing that knightly stuff.  (Laughs. You're all shy! What, you think you can't treat her right?  I'll show you. I just need a peach. A ripe one, because if you do it right? Ripe! Down there.  Well I can't teach you bananas! That would be like showing you swords! Oh! Remember, do not use it like a sword.  Well, you need to... your arse!  No, your mom's arse!  Don't want to talk about it.  It's just... frig. Frigging, piss-tossing frig!  Rrrgh!  Right, because you know what it looks like?  You knoooow.  So do all Gray Wardens have beards?  Me and Inky/Shiny/Tadwinks/'Teetness/Buckles/Honey Tongue? Fine. I mean, she's a leader. She has tension, and I get it gone.  Too much? Too much.  Who went looking for that?  We're both bony so it's like clackety-clackety-clack.  Me and Inky/Shiny/Tadwinks/'Teetness/Buckles/Honey Tongue? Good, yeah?  I mean, I'm aching. She's a handful. Two of 'em.  Too much? Too much.  Oh! Didn't you have something for her? Sorry.  It's not about you. Probably just parts. Like the beard and the... parts.  Oh... right. Huh.  Not a one. Not in person. They were killed or something?  Right, well, I suppose there’s worse, yeah?  Well yeah? Could have died defending some poncy fool’s hat. Or stepped in shit. Was it raining? Could have been raining.  Ugh! I didn't mean...! You know, beardy people are supposed to be jolly. Because if they're not, I'll yank it!  Understood?  (Laughs. Up there. Giant icicle tits! Ice.. tittles?  Oh, that's good.  No. Really?  What? That tavern tale?  That wasn't her name, but yeah, that's as far as the story ever gets. Why are you complaining?  Why would you want to stop? The whole point of the good bit is thinking about the good bit. If i tell the end, it ends!  Bunch of moaners, this! Drag out the sad shit? "Yes, please." But hang on to a good bit? "Oh, can't have that."  Frigging daft!  Beardy!  (Laughs. Grand!  I once saw the empress's arse.  Well, I didn't. I drew it and someone said it was a good likeness. That's a story about trust.  I like you, you don't talk about elfy stuff.  Right, well pbtht.  Hey, do you think they'll have pie when we get back? I could use a pie. Or three.  You'd understand if you've ever been hungry. In your bones hungry.  Know what I hear? The only thing scaring nobles more than the baddies is being asked to help us. Typical, right? Wet and running the first sign of trouble.  (Laughs.  Always knew you were up to something.  For what? Trying? Better than most ever do.  I don't get it. If you want to change, just change. Why this "fake Warden" rubbish?  (Laughs. You needed them to think you could, so you could think you could!  You're smart, but you're sort of stupid.  Knew it! Knew you could be one of us.  It'll be brilliant, right? You can flip some tables, show some nobs your arse or something.  I know!  (Laughs.  You're smirking again. Like in that fight before. What's so funny?  Well, sorry I'm scared of the stuff I've been warned about my whole lifelike most people who aren't Seekers.  Pfft! No, I have things to do. You can help by standing in front of me.  You know, you shouldn't make fun of people being scared of magic just because you can scare them back.  Not naked, you're well fit. But all armored up and fierce? What do you think some stable boy sees?  Here's what I learned in the alleys  Who's what now?  Nah, you're all right. Skip the "someone common" bit, though. Makes you seem a bit of a shit.  What was she like? The Divine, I mean. Was she as pretty as her plates?  Her plates with her portrait on. They sold them down the shops in Val Royeaux. You'd see them on walls a lot. Cost a bundle, and you couldn't even eat off them. Well, part of them. The yellowy-brown paint's poisonous. Had to keep your mash off her eyes.  You good yet, Cassandra? Can you tell me what she was like?  But you didn't know her.  Fine, whatever. I'll ask Leliana. You can tell there was something with those two. Family pain, there.  Shame, right? She was pretty.  Right, here we go. What is it from you?  You cagey, boxed up, prissy romantic!  Hey Inky/Shiny/Tadwinks/'Teetness/Buckles/Honey Tongue? We telling anyone?  No. Wait. Yes. Sorry Cassandra! But thanks!  Awwww, but you heard it, right? I heard it. Thanks, Cassandra.  You have a thing for the Inquisitor. His thing and your thing... doing things.  Awwwww. Sorry to hear it.  How's that temple of demon rubbish sitting with you, Cassandra?  Really? Lady Trained-From-Birth has no problem with a temple to "everything the Chantry says is shit."  Stop pointing that at me!  Your face. That sobby pity face. Why are you aiming it at me?  It's nothing. Just scary, rubbish demons that are done. We got out. Mostly. There. Talked. Now everything is good, right?  Good! We're all good. Phew.  The Inquisitor came back. That's all that matters. Maybe it's you who's still shaky. Everyone just needs to not think about it and feel better.  Hey, Cassandra! Were those really all your names or were you having them on?  At the Winter Palace. Were you having them on or are you really Cassandra Allergy Porta Fillomajig Pentaghast?  (Laughs. How do you remember them all?  Hey Inquisitor! Is that true? Do they fit across her underpants?  (Laughs. No way that fits across your breeches.  So you and the Inquisitor don't seem so...you know...anymore.  Yeah. Right. So is this awkward or...  That's not so bad, then.  Right. Awkward it is.  I am not. Well, now it is, but you said it!  Sure.  You need a drink or something, you tell me.  Just the thing that removes the screwy bits. I thought I put it back. I'll put it back.  Needed it for the hinges.  Like on a door? Don't worryit's not for you.  Cassandra--have you ever punched a bear?  Well, what's it for then? The training, I mean. You stand harder then Cullen's soldiers. Must be for something,  All right, all right. Just seems like you could punch a bear if you wanted.  What, the "punch a bear" thing? I don't know, I just figured you'd want to know if you could? I mean, I sometimes pot an arrow just to see if I can hit something. Did Andraste say not to use your training for fun? Fun for you, I mean. Probably not fun for the bear. You've got some reach on you.  Well. There you go, then?  What are you on about?  Pfft, you come from nobles all right. Get over yourself. I'm not even near the bottom of what real people live through.  So Cassandra, if you were trained young, how long have you been giving Andraste's hairy eyeball?  The sword-eye-hair thing. You know, "Knock-knock, Inquisition; Andraste's hairy eyeball says 'What are you doing'?"  Oooooh. You need better painters. I just figured she was ginger.  Well, there you go then.  You haven't used up all your guesses.  Well then, just... cross your legs and guess?  Some "Seeker" you are.  Oh, come on. Make another guess!  It has to be a place, not every place.  What rules? Everyone knows how to guess. Except you.  Mm, not bad. It should sound more... southern.  You're not very good at this.  Just guess. Somewhere fun.  What? No. Is that what you're trying for?  That was your question. I just hoped something on the map would rhyme with "arse". Besides, I don't know or very much care where I was born.  Aww, for me? (Laughs.  So where were you born, Cassandra?  Fine. On a pile of the softest gold, with big-hat priests patting your butt, all singing and playing trumpets?  Hard one, you. Right on the floor?  Three eggs, a canary, and a soggy biscuit!  That joke I was telling where I couldn't remember the end bit? So the man says, "Three eggs, a canary, and a soggy biscuit!" (Chuckles. Not bad, right?  Pfft. It's funny!  What's the old inquisition motto, again?  Come on.  Around the corner chocolate's made! (Laughs.  You just hate chocolate.  Maybe check with Creepy. He touches everything.  Right, which one?  Oh, that one was full on. I threw it under your bed.  Fine. Please can I NOT find more of your mucky little books. Drawings. Ew.  So you spend a lot of time around dead people. Corpses.  Pay respect. Like pose them and dress them up and such.  It sounds like a big, dead dollhouse. Dollhouses are creepy enough.  Rose! No, wait. Robin's egg.  Trying to guess the color of your underpants.  Pffft! Everyone hear that? (Laughs.  There was. Maybe. Doesn't matter now.  Why? It isn't like a Chantry where starts matter.  I'd be careful. The one in Nevarra's mean.  You’re from a rich family, Cassandra?  You say that like it’s normal. But I suppose you did live with the dead.  Well...that sounds shit.  Yes? Some of it's a bit off, but - wait, why?  What, I don't belong because I never joined some holy whatever?  I take back. And you kill people.  Ones who deserve it? Right, we're real different.  Not there Creepy. Go rooting in that part of me and I'll stripe you up, you hear?  Leave me alone.  Could someone please shut him up? Or I am going to shaft him in his creepy little eyes.  Ugh! How do you get so close to being human and then just not?  Shut it up!  Go away.  Why does it keep talking at me?  Look, could you at least not stare past my eyes? Friggin' creepy, that.  That too. Don't do that. Creepy.  It's like its face doesn't know what it's saying! Eww!  Have we been here? I mean right here, doing exactly this? It feels weird.  It's like its face doesn't know what it's saying! Eww!  What? What is it?  Go away.  Leave me alone.  That's right about enough.  Creepy is staring again! Aren't you supposed to be getting better or something? Less like you?  Well, do it somewhere else. Ugh! He's still just... wrong.  Heard enough, yeah?  The Inquisitor? A couple others. They were a bit weird, but all right.  Sure. A couple. They were all right. Bit weird.  I knew a funny boy in Denerim. Started fires with his eyes. Templars nabbed him right quick, so he's better now, I guess?  Meals and training? So he wouldn't starve or get stomped by a mob? I've seen both.  From your arse, that's where.  Arrows.  Arrows.  What?  Ohhh. Arrows.  You don't laugh like a Tevinter.  Cruel and stupid, like... (cackles  Knew it! Varric owes me a sovereign.  The people back in Tevinter, are they all just like you, Dorian?  You know; not scary, keeping their magic rubbish to themselves.  I know right? He's a pissbag.  So you're fat with it, right?  Do you sleep on silk while gold shits down all over you? Are you rich?  You really left it, huh? Knew you weren't all bad.  Yeah. Why wouldn't I?  Oh, excuse me while I dig up my diamond-studded hair-cutter whatevers.  Pppbth!!  Dorian? Those words you say. What do they mean?  No, arse, when you're mad. Pish-anty cough-ass. You're swearing, I know it.  And it means what?  (Laughs. Why not just say that?  Tell that to all the "proper" mages wavin' their tools in people's faces!  What about Coryphemus? How many "proper tools" does he have under him?  And the rebel mages? How many "proper tools" have they raised?  Right, well, I don't care how gifted you are. Don't cram it where it's not wanted.  What, Dorian? Stop looking at me.  I don't need to be familiar with your tool.  I don't care. I like you, Dorian. Don't ruin it.  So, you'll be careful when you throw all that fire around, yeah?  You magic me, I'll put three in your eye.  Do me a favor, Dorian? Give me some warning if you are going to bust out in demons or something.  So, are you going to warn me or not?  Your Magisters. They all like Corphy-face?  I mean, are they all crazy? Wanting to be gods? "Muahahaha!" like that?  And you let them live? Why?  I don't. I use normal things, not magic.  For one, it comes out a bottle. For two, I mess up, I get burned. You messed up, your head chucks up a demon. For three? Bottle, little burned, no demons. So there.  What, is there something -- oh, ha ha. Eat it.  You and the Inquisitor, hey? What is that like? Jousting?  (Laughs Nice.  Whatever, they talk plenty but if you don't play their stupid game, they're lost.  Pfft. They could try, sure.  Not when I put enough arrows in it.  Knew I’d hate it, felt like choking down a peach-pit, knowing it would end bad.  Seriously, they passed like pine-cones.  Maybe you should be nicer to certain someones.  (Laughs.  You. And Bull. (Laughs.  I know what you get.  It's like falling through a tree into custard.  "Too high! Wham! Too fast! Wham! Leaves! Wham! Splat!"  What? Is it showing?  She's different, so it doesn't matter.  Could be. Why not?  Then why didn't you say that?  What's the point of words you know, but others don't? Who would you say them to?  Pity, because we're great. That's why I'm following her around with weirdies.  Demons! Flappy robes!  Culty shits!  What? It's not a proper game of 'Your people are shit' if you make up words!  You're...well, that's...Smartasses!  Piss!  That's a surprise, innit?  A what?  Not your business if I do or didn't. Like I don't ask if you "naturally" shoot fireballs out your arse, or just opinions.  I don't doubt it. They all slaves where you're from.  You ever talked to one who wasn't?  People are people, who knew?  What’s that now?  I smile at clouds.  What, I should hunch and swear at the rain pissing off my nose? Let the weather win? I smile the frig out of clouds.  Maybe they get tired of trying.  What?  We’re both buying. Then there’s double.  Are they losing their minds in Tevinter? I bet they are.  The Inquisition. I mean, you people believe weird stuff, right? About Andraste?  The parts where you’re wrong?  Get off.  I can't fly, you daft tit!  I'd get a wedge-up something fierce!  Well, do some bloody presses!  So, Bull. What are your women like?  No, I mean, are they like you? Big and... phwoar.  (Laughs. Wow.  You're not gonna start that Qun rubbish where you try to convert me, are you?  What's so funny about that?  What's that mean? I can be a videe... vivi... one of those things.  Bloody good one, too.  All right, why wouldn't I be a good viddy-whatever?  If it's so hard, maybe it's your stuff that's stupid.  Did you see it, all down the stairs?  The one with the huge ditties?  Yeah, waaaay behind.  Too elfy.  Pffft. Whatever.  How do you and elves even work?  You're bedding the Inquisitor.  What's so funny? oh because you do it standing! (laughs  So Bull, you two are flirty right?  Frigging right you won't.  Oh that's right. You and she had.. Sorry. right?  Pfft! (laughs  Oh loosen up you! See what I did? I did it too! (laughs  I think she's turning purple.  I know right?  Power bed it's way to me. Big beautiful difference.  See? I know right?  Hey! You take that back!  But this matters. You don't talk piss about what matters.  I don't know. Can't remember.  What? No! Piss, now it’s in my head!  Why’d you say that? You ruined a good beehive! Arse.  I don't know, Can't remember.  What? Things go sideways if you think too hard.  That's why most people get stung.  Two eyes. Helps, yeah?  Well, sure, right?  That’s not Andraste. That’s Chantry.  Of course I do!  Is it supposed to? It’s belief, innit?  You're weird, Bull. You have all this Qun stuff, but you think Andraste's confusing?  There's real and there's really real.  I know what I said. I do.  Not talking about it.  No, it's just simple. Demons and rubbish. Simple.  I don't get how Qun-thing makes everyone believe exactly the same stuff.  Only if the whole point is keeping people out.  that's not what Andraste's for. Shouldn't be.  Bull, you like overthinking, right? I've got an idea.  You're not throwing piss, but I could ride on your shoulders? You run and hit, I shoot.  Sit on your own horns. I stand.  Or! Wait! No! Better idea! Ice cream in beer!  It's probably shit. It'll be great!  Seems like that business at Adamant really worked you up, huh?  We're like a guild. The "hate this rubbish" guild.  Good for you?  It’s not the hurting. It’s, ugh, parts.  So?  I don’t need to think about what I do. I do what I do.  So you're free now or something? Must be nice to get rid of those Ben-Harseholes.  You like drinking and singing and breaking beds. You'd already left.  Pfft, heard that before. Don't worry. You get growly, I'll kick your arse.  Wait, Bull. All that rot you said about hacking people.  You do like it?  That’s weird.  (Spoken nervously Right. Bring on the baddies.  Oh, him, yeah! You're welcome!  I wanted to see if I could get him without hitting you.  That's not a thing. Get faster.  All right, next time we fight someone, I'm gonna pin their foot to the ground.  Then you run at 'em and shout, "flowerpot!" as you go.  Because it's funny!  Just shut up and do it!  Ew. Parts are gross.  Killing, whatever. But when a bit comes off, it's not them anymore.  You don't see that? It's like, suddenly meat.  (if in the party (laughs Arse-Kettle.  (if in the party Psst, nice try. You'll run him hard.  You two are such men.  Didn't see no spiders. I'd have taken bloody spiders.  So... it's in my head? Knowing is not helping!
