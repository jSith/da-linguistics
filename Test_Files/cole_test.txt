She has to reach the other side of the hill.  The Knight-Captain. But she's injured.  ...I don't know. The hill went away.  Yes. It makes me tired, and doesn't work if they're loud. Or angry. Or bright.  Maybe. Like what?  They were staring at me.  In Skyhold. The servants in the courtyard. They were looking at me and whispering.  What's wrong with my hat?  Should I change my hat?  A silk shirt with three buttons left undone.  My shoelaces keep coming untied.  Can you talk to them? They don't listen to me.  I like travelling with Dwarves.  You're quiet, but the old song still echoes inside, almost like templars.  But he died at the end of the last book. If he comes back, the readers will be confused.  It was the shape that would help.  It had to be him. But harmless. The him he wanted that wouldn't hurt.  He didn't need me.  What would I learn? I can hear when they need me.  I'll... try.  How do you make them calm?  Everyone. You talk and the fear fades, slipping to sleep. Not always happy, but not angry.  Cats swat my feet even when no one can see me.  "If you don't get some sunshine, you'll wilt." She says she's not a plant, she's fine, but falling, faltering, foolish. Blood on her hands, people and demons always end in trouble. Too many Daisies in this garden.  I am good, Varric. I am me. You don't need to worry... but thank you for caring.  The heft in my hands, solid, strong, but curving, careful, like her. Soot smudge on her cheek. Tiny scars on her fingers, old fires. Her little frown when she twists a gear ever so slightly.  Your stories aren't real. But then people read them and they are!  So many people reading, dreaming, feeling. Spirits spill around the veil making shapes. Reality from writing!  Do you write to reach across? To hear the song that was sundered?  Does she use a big sword, or a sword and shield?  "The next time you imagine him touching you, someone you love will die."  She knows who he is. Does it not work for your book?  Two pairs beats one pair. Four of a kind beats two pairs. She slips the ace of dragons into a thigh-high boot, calls to the barman for another round. Blondie stares at the table, angry, always angry.  Do they ever stop talking to you?  The people in your head. They aren't real, but they have voices and thoughts and sometimes you see through their eyes.  I think I have it. Let me try again.  Knock, knock.  Cole.  It's me, Cole. That is my name.  Knock, knock.  The Inquisition.  That's who we are, Varric?  Knock, knock.  Me.  Me. And I'm telling a knock knock joke.  No? I go where the knife needs to be.  Knock, knock.  Dragon.  Dragons really don't like wyverns.  You do think about it a lot.  Solas doesn't fear spirits, Vivienne. Why do you?  The Circle makes you afraid? Are the demons stronger there?  Solas is my friend!  I have a body. And Solas has nothing to fear from me. Neither do you... unless you attack first. I like the Fade, but I can help here. I could help you if you let me.  I can't return to the Fade. Sometimes I wish I could.  You're afraid. You don't have to be.  She's afraid!  Everything bright, roar of anger as the demon rears. No, I will not fall. No one will control me ever again.  Flash of white as the world comes back. Shaking, hollow, Harrowed, but smiling at templars to show them I'm me.  I am not like that. I can protect you. If templars come for you, I will kill them.  Stepping into the parlor, hem of my gown snagged, no, adjust before I go in, must look perfect.  Voices inside. Marquis Alphonse.  "I do hope Duke Bastien puts out the lights before he touches her. But then, she must disappear in the dark."  Gown tight between my fingers, cold all over. Unacceptable. Wheels turn, strings pull.  He hurt you. You left a letter, let out a lie so he would do something foolish against the Inquisition. A trap.  Nugs are kind, Almost everything is bigger than they, but they're still happy.  If you hold out your hand, they will nuzzle it. It's how they call you "friend."  Nugs aren't dangerous.  Grass doesn't mind anything. People walk on it, horses eat it, it's always content.  Do you feel spirits move around you when you cast a spell?  Bits of them push through with your magic, tiny, a wisp of a wisp, free before falling back. They pool around you, water in a cup, defined, deafened, hearing only your song.  They want to skate, scintillate on skin. You made them. Their Maker.  Are you still afraid of me, Vivienne?  Dorian is like you, Vivienne.  The Veil sings around both of you. It whispers through you and makes you both brighter.  No. For most mages, it's a tool. A toil. You make it you.  You were not at the Spire when the rebellion started Vivienne. I tried to protect the mages, I would remember you.  I didn't know what I was. When mages were afraid, their pain called me and I set them free.  I killed them so the templars couldn't hurt them anymore.  It was wrong. I'm sorry.  Yes.  The templars hurt mages.  You're lying. You're... twist the words right, and it will show its true form. Blood or banishment, either will suffice.  You like the tamplars. You think they were right.  You don't need to be protected.  A sour smell in the Tower library, rotten meat and ashes. Too quiet without the apprentices. Something crunches underfoot. Burned finger bones glitter in the ash like pearls. Ice in my veins. The archivist... what was her name?  Why did they kill her? She was just like them!  Yes. I am no danger now.  You worried for me.  No. You were worried. The part of you that forgets I'm me cared. You want it to go away.  You think caring makes you weak. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.  Where? If I go, the mages could find me.  You don't use blood magic, Vivienne.  Trembling, my knife at his throat. Not this, not this, swore I'd do whatever they asked but not this. In death, sacrifice. His hand grips my wrist, pulls the blade across his throat. I'm sorry.  No. They were free, unbound, banished back where they belonged. I liked watching the rocks break the walls. Falling fortresses, old dead fears cracking like flakes of blood. It was better than last time.  Yes.  It came last time, too.  You were happy at the Winter Palace, Vivienne.  You were still sharp, but happy. Golden, glittering, everything gleamed. Rules that let you win.  That's why you're happier being a noble than a mage. You fear demons, not people.  Gown perfect, shoes perfect, hat perfect, staff a symbol, not a weapon. My room, my people. Mine.  I don't understand Celene and Gaspard.  There's no hurt. Nothing there touched you.  How do you make a Game that you always win?  Uncultured barbarian witch.  Jaws ache, dress stiff, binding. Years of work, favors fought, deals dealt, and the witch usurped my position.  You're angry at Morrigan. She took what you had without working.  Celene did not make you go away. She respected you.  Wind is always going someplace. What happens when it gets there?  So many spirits clustering around. Pressing against the Veil, calling your name. Vivienne! Vivienne! Look at me!  Demons can't hear you. It hurts too much. Nothing here makes sense to them.  You're different, Solas. Sharper. You're in both places.  Spirit or demon.  It's brighter here. Glittering. Glaring. Glinting. I can't...  But... what is here?  (Breathes. Thank you.  I made the scullery maid stop crying and one of the boys in the stable is happier. Some of the servants are angry. My help makes work for them. Do you want me to stop?  Yes. I will not be that again.  You are quiet, Solas.  No, inside. I don't hear your hurt as much. Your song is softer, subtler, not silent but still.  There is pain though, still within you.  You don't need to envy me, Solas. You can find happiness in your own way.  They are not gone so long as you remember them.  But you could let them go.  You didn't do it to be right. You did it to save them.  You weren't wrong, though.  I am sorry your friend died, Solas.  I didn't know there were spirits of wisdom.  I will try not to die.  Bright and brilliant, he wanders the ways, walking, unwaking, searching for wisdom.  Your friend wanted you to be happy, even though she knew you wouldn't be.  He comes to me as though the Fade were just another wooded path to walk without a care in search of wisdom.  We share the ancient mysteries, the feelings lost, forgotten dreams, unseen for ages, now beheld in wonder.  In his own way, he knew wisdom, as no man or spirit had before.  Is there a way to save more spirits, Solas?  Pushing through makes you be yourself. You can hold onto the you.  Being pulled through means you don't have enough you. You become what batters you, bruises your being.  Then we will help them.  If it helps enough people, it becomes more... wandering, wishing, touched by them, Maker loves you, and it grows.  But I am me. Will I be more one day, if I help enough? Is this a task, timed, temporary?  So I am always this?  I don't know. He hurt me... hurt the real Cole. I'm angry at him.  I can't let that go. I have to become more, let it make me real.  When did you see it before?  No, you didn't. It's harder to hear, sometimes. Sorry.  I am me. I cannot be bound, broken. I will help the hurt and kill the killers.  Well wishing, waiting for once. Clean and clear, uncluttered.  Can I help you? You healed my hurt, but yours is old inside, vast across the Veil.  Yes.  I can. I am light, unlittered. I can slip back across a small kind thing.  I can help here.  (If the Inquisitor kept the vallaslin Stop. You are perfect exactly as you are. But then you turned away. Why?  She feels her face, marked, marred without malice. She didn't know. She thinks it's why you walked away.  (If the Inquisitor had the vallaslin removed Ar lasa mala revas. You are so beautiful. But then you turned away. Why?  She is bare-faced, embarrassed, and she doesn't know. She thinks it's because of her.  He hurts, an old pain from before, when everything sang the same.  You're real, and it means everyone could be real. It changes everything, but it can't.  They sleep, masked in a mirror, hiding, hurting, and to wake them... (gasps Where did it go?  I'm sorry.  She wants a Chantry but it does other things instead.  But it also spend time with her. It wanted to fall, feeling.  Why did it only talk facing one way?  It sees him ready to jump. Pain pounding, pulsing, life of frustration can finally fall, to freeze.  It holds him high, shows the hole, were everything falls without him. He never needs to leave. He matters here.  You think it is different.  That's much sadder. But yes. Calm, comfort, as the cold takes him away.  It makes sense. It holds them as they die. But then it's a man, and he wants a woman. Why?  But it changed. It is blank, black, blunted from being. It never wanted before.  No.  They can only return to the Maker if they become real. Why can't they be forgiven as they are?  Yes.  Why would they want to prove the Maker wrong? He's already far away.  And rolling the ball so it goes in the hole.  A war in the Fade waged with human hate. (Shudders. I should never want to see that.  It was wrong to hide it in the child. It hurt her.  They left for love, and then love lost them. More pain, more joy than anyone can bear, and yet they embrace it.  It was a game, but more than a game. It meant he would get a family.  Why didn't they help at the end?  They didn't give the boy what he wanted.  They gave him a new one. He wanted his old one. I would have done it better.  Why would they want to make people fight? Why would they fight the Maker?  The brothers shouldn't fight. They should tell their troubles. Their father didn't teach them to talk.  Solas is not a thing.  It's good. I can explain.  You want to be the one with the words that wander.  I like the stories in her head more than the stories on the page.  She tried. The cookies were good until the hate made it bitter in your mouth.  Everyone heard. You're scary in another place.  Sera. My tongue wants to whistle on the start. Sera. But it has to stay still or the r is a d. Sera. Seda. Seda. De da de da. If you try, you can say it without moving your mouth, see? Serrra. Say it enough and it stops being a word. Sera, Sera, Sera, Sera, Serraa.  You like to dance, but can't. You hate to sing, but can. You should not paint. It would be very bad if you did.  You... you called me him. Thank you!  You don't have to be afraid Sera. I won't hurt you.  I won't stab you when you are looking somewhere else. I won't do that to your boots. Or that other thing to your arrows. I don't understand what that last thing is, but I won't do it either.  You're not your eyes, you live behind them.  Your bow was a tree once. A girl with a long name met a boy with strong hands there.  Her body warm, leaning against the trunk, hair tangled in branches and fingers. "Forever, no matter what."  They cut letters in the bark. When her parents took her away, he cut the letters away to forget.  Every time you pull it, the part that was a tree remembers. Can you feel it under your fingers?  When you fire your bow, it hums after, every time.  Your mind makes it quiet, but if you heard it backwards, it would sound longer, a thrum through the gut.  But don't think about it, or you'll tense your shoulder like you do, and then your shot will go too far left.  Yes. But not how you mean.  In the soft thin places, spirits push with memories that didn't happen. Or did. Or might.  Before the door is open. They could just let the cat out, and it would always be alive.  The sky wants to say something. It's trying, tempting, words in the wind, whistling, wandering, wasted.  It's going to rain. Not here, but somewhere. The thunder will sound like her belly after the soup.  I like how you see where the arrow will land without being there.  It's falling and flying, free in flight, all the same, like looking through the Fade.  You didn't know the custard would bring the cats.  It made everything different. No one slipped, but the tails were like little people, bobbing as they lapped it up.  I'm still me. I just remember more.  Sera, you're confused. I can help.  The joke means the horns on the cow's head, but there are different horns that make noise when you blow them.  It's funny because the cow horns and music horns are very different. Cullen explains it better.  (if in party I'm lost.  (if in partyLeaves.  Why does she carry a jar down there? Is there something in her hands?  I don't understand.  I like your horns, The Iron Bull.  But they're dragon horns, not bull horns. You could have named yourself The Iron Dragon.  Barman laughs. Slides the drink over. Tankard in view the whole time, no chance poison was added. Blade at his waist. Club under the bar. Moves with training, mercenary or guard. Use that if I have to.  Why, The Iron Bull?  Do you think about how to kill everyone you meet?  Vasaad was angry. He went first because he wanted to fight. Taking point, then points take him, red on his neck.  Even if you went in first, there would have been another fight, another time he didn't listen. It wasn't your fault.  You can use sadness?  Yes. And you're The Iron Bull, afraid of demons.  Lying awake, sheets soaked in sweat, afraid to call the Tamassrans. Shadows make shapes in the dark.  If it gets in my head, how do I cut it out? Itching, shaking, tears slide cold down my cheeks. "Tama, I'm scared."  It is? Good.  I have to lift my feet, or the rocks make noise when I walk.  Can I lift my feet?  Yes. She danced. Then I untangled the hurt that made her angry at her mother.  I helped her write a letter to send back home. She said I could call her Marguerite, the name didn't hurt anymore.  The Iron Bull, do you ever worry about a demon standing to your left where your eye can't see?  Raw and hot, trying to open it, but just darkness. How bad, how bad? No, done now, no sense worrying.  The man they hurt coughs, shaking, but sits up. Eyes wide. No, not a man, a woman, clothes torn.  "You're safe now. I'm Iron Bull. What do you want me to call you?"  You got to pick your name, The Iron Bull.  You made it a joke on yourself, making a mockery, so you would never be that.  You and Krem say words that hurt, but they aren't real, The Iron Bull.  It means friendship. And that you're soldiers. Krem likes it, it makes him proud.  Is that wrong?  The armor is right. The body isn't, but it doesn't hurt him anymore.  You make it better.  Blood, crash of metal, but silent underneath - the horn didn't blow! That one-eyed bastard, I knew he'd betray us!  They died fighting. In your mind, they hated you, but you're doing it wrong! That isn't what Krem thought!  "Horns pointing up."  No, that didn't help - I tugged on the tangle and tore it--  "Tama, how will I follow the Qun?" Her hands, strong but gentle, ruffles stubs where the horns will be.  "You are strong, and your mind is sharp. You will solve problems others cannot." She smiles, but sadly.  Agents with hushed tones. Eyes stinging, forms to fill out, course corrections, reduce risk of similar losses.  I remember the little boy, too wise, eager to help. Words break in small secret spaces. He got away. He got away.  Your hurt touches hers.  The Iron Bull, a woman in the last village wanted you to pick her up and take her clothes off.  In her mind, you were very big.  When we fight, you make them not people, so their death doesn't stick to you.  I see it. A wall of wounds. Nothing on this side has a family.  What if someone attacks you in a tavern?  The Iron Bull, in one fight, you let someone hit you so they wouldn't hit me.  But you hate demons.  Oh. Thank you.  All right.  Do you wish you were faster, the Iron Bull?  Then it's them, not you. You don't want to kill. You want to defend.  But you give them a chance. You make them choose. So it's their fault. You are big, boasting, battering, and I blend behind, daggers in darkness, one-two-three.  She/He almost says the word sometimes. Katoh. She/He tastes it in her/his mouth, sweet release a breath away, tongue tying it tenderly like you tie her/him. But she/he doesn't. For you, and for her/him because it makes it mean more. A fuller feeling, a brighter burst.  Not just in bed. Sometimes it's up against the wall. Once on the war table.  Oh, sorry.  You act like you're in charge, The Iron Bull, but it's really him/her.  S/he decides when, and you measure it carefully, enough to enjoy, to energize, but never to anger.  S/he is tied, teased, tantalized, but it's tempered to what s/he wants. S/he submits, but you serve.  What's an Orlesian Tickler?  No, you won't.  But...  Sorry.  Yes.  The world doesn't make sense to them. It's too real. That's why they look wrong.  I want to help. Looking doesn't matter.  But I don't want to look like something else.  They would use it to hurt people.  I thought I had to. But I don't. The old songs can pull me.  Is that why you bleed?  You ask a lot of questions, Dorian.  I'm curious about you, too.  Good! Thank you!  Dorian, you said I could ask you questions.  Why are you so angry at your father? He wants to help and you know he does, but...  You love him, but you're angry. They mix together, boiling in the belly until it kneads into a knot.  "Love isn't enough." Enough what? You didn't explain, Dorian.  His face in the stands, watching as I pass the test. So proud there's tears in his eyes.  Anything to make him happy, anything.  Why isn't that true anymore?  I'm hurting you, Dorian. Words winding, wanting, wounding. You said I could ask.  But it hurts. I want to help, but it's all tangled with the love, I can't tug it loose without tearing it.  You hold him so tightly. You let it keep hurting, because you think hurting is who you are. Why would you do that?  I'm sorry. I keep making it worse.  Get out. You are no son of mine.  He wishes he hadn't meant it.  There were so many wonderful hats.  Dancing is hard. You have to listen with your feet as well as your heart.  That's a lot to do all at once.  You're happier now, Dorian.  Wishing but wondering, wounded and wistful. What if he doesn't want me after?  Now you're smiling! It's good.  Why did you leave your home, Dorian?  It was more...it was the man with your eyes...angry, walking on cobblestones, 'I'm on my own now'  You said I could ask questions!  It won't hurt me. It's friendly fire.  Your clothes look like the Fade, Dorian.  It's shiny.  Can you feel the bits of Fade around you when you cast spells, Dorian?  They pool around the Veil, pulled by power, then push through to see this side.  I don't think it says that.  They're real. What else would they be?  Do you conjure yours? Is that why they look like that?  It has to be hurt, or a way to help the hurt. That's what calls me.  Rilienus, skin tan like fine whiskey, cheekbones shaded, lips curl when he smiles.  He would have said yes.  Dorian, am I handsome?  You say you're handsome all the time. Am I? I can't tell.  But I like my hats.  Dorian, what's a slave?  But you said I could ask questions.  Dorian, I really wish you would tell me.  No.  No. I'm not a wooden duck.  Yes? I couldn't find one with little wheels, though. I'm sorry.  Yes. Don't you?  Don't your spells whisper things to you? What is and could be, music in the mind of strange, far away places?  Then we don't hear the same thing.  Fear inside. Blackness like a pool of hate. So much has changed, I need to stop it. Bend it to my will.  Betrayal. Blurred at the edges, like a faded painting. Too long ago, so much confusion.  There were people trying to kill me. That makes it harder.  Not yet.  No, no no no no. This is the Fade, but I'm stuck. I can't... why can't I... ?  This place is wrong. I made myself forget when I made myself real, but I know it wasn't like this.  Wrong, wrong, wrong. Wringing me out. Wrought right and rigid. Can't relax. Can't release...  Thank you.  It should be like home. It's not. This isn't me, not this part.  So do I.  I'll try. It's hard.  No.  Small fears, too small to shape the Fade themselves. Clinging to the Nightmare. Feeding on the bits it leaves behind.  They want your fear, so they look how you feel.  Yes. Or spirit. I want it to be spirit.  Yes. Like you.  A sack on the side of the road, struggling. The boy runs from it, crying.  You would stop it if you could. That is enough. But don't do it again.  "One by one they follow me, laughing, drowning in the sea."  The rest of the poem is sad.  So many masks.  Not at the ball. Here.  Mockingbird, mockingbird, quiet and still, what do you see from the top of that hill? Can you see up? Can you see down?  Can you see the dead things all about town?  It just came to me. Everyone says everyone knows it. The children knew it.  How do you get the hair on your face?  He doesn't have hair on his face. Is it a mask?  I could try.  We played by the fire so she would be warm. No, it's summer, Liddy.  Got her a flower but they'd taken her. Left it on her bed. Next eight on the sill.  Tourney sands. A garden seat. Five to Chantry altars. One to a child with her hair. The sea? Too many to count.  And thirty-six. Tossed off the battlements today.  You have many feelings.  I'm sorry she died.  Your knife is big.  It's bigger than mine.  I don't know. How does a Warden become Grey?  There was once a man who had bees coming out of his mouth?  Your head. So many tangles. Knots. And that's just on the inside.  You need a hairbrush.  "Something interesting"?  When you charge at them, you make them hit you.  Golden, graceful, glittering but not gaudy. Voice delicate and delectable.  Sweet, soft, and silky. Her dress, and also under her dress. Are you going to talk to Josephine?  Do you want to hear what she thinks of you?  You should.  I heal the helpless. Give hope where there is hurt.  Yes. Before I knew what I was.  It hurts too much. I can't be me, have to be someone who never killed.  Help enough, and I'm different. I'm not me. Believe it to become it.  We can change, if we want it enough.  I'm not really real.  They already want to forget me. I find the part that doesn't fit and set it free. Their mind makes a shape that makes sense without me.  I'm sorry you have to stay. It wouldn't work for them. You were trying to fix it. It isn't your fault.  They wanted Blackwall, not Rainier. That's why the others are angry.  No.  You never hid from me.  "Mockingbird, mockingbird." Too many voices in the carriage. Maker, they're young.  If I tell my men to stop, they'll know it was all a lie. Cold, trapped, heart hammering like axes on a carriage door.  Everyone hides dead things. Everyone pretends. You wanted to fix it.  You don't want to be. You made a new you. You are Blackwall. You killed Rainier.  You would stand between Rainier and the carriage. But you can't. It doesn't work like that.  So you carry the bodies to remember.  Yes. I tried to kill him. I thought it would fix it, fix me.  No. But I'm more real now. I'll remember.  It hurts.  Realer.  Blech.  You know a lot about girls.  Stop. It isn't about you.  Callier. His family. His children. You wonder if some part of them watches you still.  You wonder if they want you to feel guilty, if they want you to make up for what you did... but they don't.  If they're watching, all they want is not to have died. It isn't about you.  If you want to remember, remember this  And if I become a demon again and hurt people, you will kill me.  Yes. His hurt is healed. So is mine.  He was frightened. The other Templars were older. He didn't know what to do.  Afraid of them, afraid of me, can't face it, lock it away and pretend it wasn't real.  He fled far away, tried to forget, to be someone new.  He was.  Yes. He knows he left the Templars, but I'm not there. He just knows they made him someone he didn't want to be.  Why?  Isn't the world better that way?  I understand. Making the Templar forget what he did to me is like making you forget Rainier.  My pain was his pain. It made the amulet not work. We both had to let it go.  Isn't me not hurting more important than him being punished?  You think that if you forget, you will become like that again. But you're not him. You have other things to carry. You can put the bodies down.  Yes. Help the hurt, save the small. If I become a demon, cut me down.  Good.  Yes. I hope you are, too.  You're a better Seeker than Lambert. You care about everyone.  I killed him. He cared more about stopping mages than protecting people.  Pathetic mages. Crush them at Andoral's Reach or starve them out. Doesn't matter which.  I need an example, Seekers succeeding, seizing power. Overthrow the Divine, triumphant in the eyes of the Maker.  You believe I killed him.  I was there. I didn't need proof.  He used rules to hurt people. He always found a way to be right, even when he killed my friend.  A pretty Templar. She died protecting Rhys and me, but she got better.  He would have hurt people.  Why not? He made templars see monsters instead of mages, made them push until it all fell down.  But not by him.  Yes. Thank you for remembering. Sometimes people forget me.  Most sounded the same, but the leaders they listened to were hurt, hollowed, sick with a new song.  They swallowed lies until they sang with darker music. The sound hollowed them.  I wanted them to stop me if I harmed people, but I had to stop them instead.  Oh, wait. You had a question.  Like helping people?  Oh. That makes more sense.  You found faith, not just a feeling. It was a spirit.  I'm a spirit that touched a body, you're a body that touched a spirit. We're the same but backwards!  It's you, Cassandra.  Breathing from the belly, cold air warmed, stones beneath me, candle before me, Maker all around.  Then nothing, empty, I'm cut, cauterized, then caught, cleansed by a light that carries me home.  You're thinking backwards. You don't have faith because of the spirit. The spirit came because of your faith.  It's you.  I don't know if I'll ever forgive him. But I can live with him.  Killing him won't make anything better. It's more complicated than that.  I don't understand all of it. I'm trying.  There were beatings, worse than beatings. "If you tell anyone, I'll say you used blood magic."  Not all Templars were like that. But not enough could stand up to the ones who were.  You'd take advice from a demon?  I was wrong to kill Lambert, wasn't I, Cassandra?  I can see more. I could have helped the rebel mages. I could have warned someone.  Things are connected, tied in a tangle. Fixing one thing might break something else.  How do you do it?  I was never a spirit of faith, but thank you. I will try to be more like you.  Yes.  Templars.  Don't be. You and Cullen care. That's more than most.  Light pastry with blueberries, sticky on your fingers. Small hands reaching as Anthony tears his in half.  But when you got to the kitchen, they were all gone.  I would get you one, but they see me in the kitchen now. They ask if I want a glass of water, a piece of bread. They want to help me. It should be the other way around.  Yes. I am unbound, unbowed, old wounds unbroken.  I can be me, no fear of falling.  Anthony falls, blood spraying, not the blood they wanted. If a scream were a blade, revenge would be easy.  You didn't fall, but you faltered. Anger makes you other. You understand.  Yes. Beatings, worse. "Do you remember telling me no? You can't do that now. The Tranquil don't say no to anything."  Not all, but enough. The good templars were too afraid to stop the others.  Compassion and faith. Not all, but a start. I can help. I can try.  Light pastry with blueberries, sticky on your fingers. Small hands reaching as Anthony tears his in half.  But when you got to the kitchen, they were all gone.  I could get you one. The cooks don't see me.  You're sad about the Seekers.  The room with the candle. It wasn't a lie. Your faith was real.  Belly knotted, the candle burns like the sun. No voice but my own for months. "Blessed are they who stand before the corrupt and the wicked and do not falter."  It will be enough.  Voices sing, but the hawk has flown away and cannot hear them. Standing by the door. Legs stuck. I shouldn't be here.  Where is his sister? Is she crying? Can she breathe? I couldn't breathe. Pain twists, but for which one?  It isn't your fault he/she died.  Can you know it more?  The frame holds, hand at the waist moves as body and thought spiral  Notes drip through the air.  [humming]  No, but it's your favorite song.  Where would the Inquisition go?  The Wardens wanted to help, but they hurt people instead. You would have sent them away, Cassandra.  If the Inquisition stops helping, where would we go to keep people safe from us?  Prayer isn't a place. It would not save them from us.  The Wardens thought the same. So did the templars.  Warden-Commander Clarel wasn't like you, Cassandra.  She fell because she fell. That's how Erimond convinced her to hurt people. He made it look like bravery.  She called it a choice, but it was a lie. She was afraid.  You aren't afraid. You won't fall.  No. Erimond is an asshole.  Shield catches the blow, blade comes down, shiver through the hilt as it cuts. Another bandit falls.  A good strike, Lucius would have been proud. The bandit's eyes meet mine as he falls, so afraid. Such a waste.  You don't need to feel bad.  Not that. You feel bad for being proud of it.  You couldn't help the bandits. Some people have to die. Being happy for your skill doesn't make you cruel.  Do you ever take off your armor and talk to it?  It might say something nice.  Your elbow made him smile.  The blacksmith's apprentice. He repaired the armor. He was too shy to ask if you were satisfied.  He saw you smile as you tested the joint. It made him happy.  My elbows don't make anyone smile.  You don't like dead people, Cassandra.  The ones in the dark city. Wrapped in cloths that smell like sunflowers. You hated the singing.  Maybe dead people like the singing.  Your uncle misses you, Cassandra.  No. He wrote you a letter. There was pain in the page.  It was Anthony's.  You did lose it. I had to fight a rat for it.  He wasn't a very big rat.  Cassandra, who's... Regalyan?  You were thinking about the time you—  My hat wouldn't fit there...
