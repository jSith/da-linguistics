This guard captain from Kirkwall that you're friends with...  Right. Just checking.  I once met a dwarf who made the best home-brewed ale.  What are you on about?  Try "someone with a strong arm and a stronger will to fight darkspawn."  Wanting to kill more darkspawn.  Excuse me?  No.  No, I don't. This conversation is over.  I can see how that describes me perfectly.  Nice. Right. I take it you didn't like this person.  Is it true that Kirkwall's Knight Commander became a... statue.  No one's moved it... I mean her?  They don't actually do that, do they?  I read some of your book. Riveting stuff. "Hard in Hightown", was it?  Well I... uh, found it in a latrine in a village near churneau. It... was missing some pages.  I've been to Kirkwall. The Hanged Man, actually, probably been twenty years now. It was a dive if I remember correctly.  Yes, I heard it was a haunt of yours.  What do you mean?  Huh. I don't suppose you follow jousting?  That's not actually true, you know.  All right. Greatest knight in history. My money's on Lady Honorine Chastain. No one's ever come close to unhorsing more riders than her. I've seen her joust live, and I have to tell you, up close? She has magnificent ti-- technique.  There's got to be... trouble or something up near Markham.  Winning while barely clinging to your horse may count, but it's not exactly the stuff of legend, is it?  You can't really think Reeve Asa is a better knight than Honorine Chastain. Her record's flawless. Four hundred jousts, never unseated. No one's ever come close to it.  You are quite the artist with that bow, Varric.  You have to aim her. Precisely. I don't think I could do that.  Exactly. And just being in the thick of it.  Slasher? Gasher? Pokey?  Do I really have a choice?  But you probably got to wash it down with an expensive wine. Mine was two year old hard tack. You can't scrape off the blue any more. You just try not to look.  I've got one for you, Varric. Best tavern name you've ever seen. I'm torn between "The Bed and Bucket", and "The Bottom of the Barrel".  Oh, so you don't think I'm dreadful now.  That's much nicer than saying "You're a dirty liar.", I'll take it.  I don't know. It'll take time earn back her trust, if I ever do.  Don't you mean "the back"?  No. Never occurred to me. End of story.  So... Worst place you've ever been?  You're gonna make me talk to her, aren't you?  No. No, you are not getting me into this conversation.  Can we talk about something else? Revasa! Revasa is the best, you were right!  You're suggesting I woo the lady with someone else's words? You really want me on that path again?  Would you care to repeat that?  Are you all right, Lady Vivienne?  In our last fight, I saw you take a blow. If I'd been there quicker  I appear to have offended.  What fault do you find with me, Vivienne? I've tried to be civil.  Then what am I doing wrong?  Evidently, I offend you just by existing, Vivienne. What is it you want me to do?  Look, I wasn't trying to imply that you  You enjoy mocking my involvement with the Inquisition. What about yours?  People like you, nobles, you send men to do your dirty work, your killing.  And here you are getting your hands dirty. Curious.  You must miss the comforts of your mansions, traveling with us as you do.  Would you like a silk handkerchief to wipe the mud off your greaves, Lady Vivienne?  Says the woman encrusted in crystals.  No matter how much you pretend I'm furniture, I'm a person--with ears. That can hear you.  Why do you care so little for those in need?  It's obvious.  Changing lives is hardly "nothing."  Do you have no sympathy for the mage rebellion?  I understand that mages are dangerous.  I know that if I had to face you, alone, I wouldn't stand a chance.  But must it be more complicated than treating people the way you'd like to be treated?  I'm sorry? Were you saying something to me?  The Heart of Spring? From Verchiel?  I wasn't always a drifter.  You know, I do have to admire you for your poise...  And I look forward to the day when that veneer crumbles.  But I'm an ill-bred vagabond from the woods! Common courtesy is beyond me.  And? Surely, you're not ending this on a complimentary note.  Ah, I see. You think we're a poor match.  Lady Vivienne, that woman there will stand with Thedas' mightiest because of who she is.  She may choose whomever she pleases, even an undeserving nobody.  Envy her for her ability to love freely, but recognize that envy is what it is.  I am sorry for your loss.  I do mean it, despite our differences.  How can you possibly dislike the Grey Wardens, Vivienne?  Say that again when a blight's at your door.  Say that again when a blight's at your door.  Ah, the lady finds me funny! I have some use after all.  Indeed, I count myself quite lucky.  Few of us have the privilege of setting aside our masks, don't you think?  I can hear both of you.  Whose idea was that, then?  Skyhold. How did you find it?  Now you sound like Cole. You looked?  Elfroot. Do elves just call it "root?"  Well, that's no fun.  I just realized, I've never seen an elf with a beard.  You've seen many things in the Fade, how do you know they're true?  I am sorry about your... friend. Losing someone is difficult.  I... don't know what to say.  Sera and I were just talking about you. We need you to settle a question for us.  Yes, probably. Sorry.  You make friends with spirits in the Fade. So... um, are there any that are more than just friends?  If you know what I mean.  Look, it's a natural thing to be curious about!  It's a simple yes or no question!  Aha! So you do have experience in these matters!  Don't panic. It'll be our little secret.  Now who's twelve?  We all have.  What's that supposed to mean?  What happened at Redcliffe, have you ever seen its like, Solas?  Magic has little place in a war between men.  I wish the Chantry could better enforce restrictions against its use.  Those red templars... how could any soldier let that happen to them?  I suppose you might look down upon them, as a mage.  Val Royeaux, huh? I remember the first time I visited it, some thirty years ago. The market was not half as large, without the garish statues. And far fewer stands selling those ridiculous frilly little cakes.  You saw this in the Fade?  Must have been ages ago.  Not my Order, as you well know.  What about them?  Yes... why do you sound so skeptical? Doesn't everyone know this?  Retire?  Right. Where are you going with this?  You remind me of someone I used to know. He was fascinated with the Fade and spirits too.  No, just a man who liked eating these strange purple cactus berries.  I don't think he was ever actually in the Fade.  Oh. (Sighs. I was running new recruits through some drills. Should I be quieter next time?  Do you have any advice for fighting demons, Solas?  So I should try not to die? Helpful.  Ahh, that is helpful! I will try to remember that.  You spoke of seeing death and destruction. Did you fight in a war?  An elven skirmish?  I was a soldier. And I... well... you know how it is.  For all your experience, Solas, you don't carry yourself like a soldier.  Ah, youth.  But too much passion, and they end up deador monsters better off dead.  You haven't said much to me since... well, you know.  I know that. I see it every time I look in a mirror. I try to make up for it.  You were right, though. I deserved it.  This? This war? The Inquisition?  Yes. Is that a problem?  I expected you to think that I should keep punishing myself.  What of you, then? Have you found someone to share a moment's respite?  The two of you make no sense sometimes.  Whatever it takes to keep the world safe.  If that's what necessary. Hey, you're here too.  She doesn't have the hair for it.  Why cakes when you can give them a two-fingered salute and a box full of dog shit.  You know I hate the aristocracy as much as you do. I hate that they sit in palaces, sipping wine while people starve outside their gates. I hate that good soldiers die in senseless wars over who gets the fancy chair.  Still, it's better to have the nobility on your side than not. They're dogs, all of them, and even the primped and powered ones have teeth.  Milady's adept at her special brand of warfare.  Yes, Sera, you go right on ahead.  You'll what? I worry where this might be going.  And the goal would be?  I don't know what to say.  Oh, Sera. I do love you.  What? Squeeze up to who?  Maker, Sera. No. Stay out of it.  No, it's not––  Please, no peaches, ripe or otherwise.  How do I make this stop?  You should learn to watch your back.  (Sighs. Great. I'm glad we understand each other.  Trouble with you and...  Right. Right.  Uh huh. Tavern later? We can drink everything. Pick you out a serving wench.  Fine. You can pick me one.  That breach. It's hard to look away from sometimes.  No. No it doesn't.  Just me. I stole all the beards, and all the power held within. There can be only one.  How are you two?  Hold on to it, Sera. Good things in wartime are rare as hen's teeth.  Heh. Nevermind.  Not really. Nothing serious.  That is me.  You were in Denerim during the Blight, Sera? Did you see many Grey Wardens?  Or something. Betrayed while defending a nation.  Is there?  Point made. Could have been worse.  Yes, there certainly is.  Understood.  You're looking for "titsicles."  Right, how's it end?  Come on! You left off elbow deep in... circumstances. That can't be it.  Because I can't stop thinking about it. I need to know the end!  Fuzzyhead.  Congratulations?  Like you'd know what you're talking about.  That's... a lot of pie for one person.  I knew a duke who actually had a servant follow him to war with corks in case his bowels loosened. Called him his "retainer."  Sorry.  For one, people wanted me dead. Being someone else kept me breathing.  And then, knowing that people thought I was good made it easier.  Hey, when this is all done, if you ever need my help for anything, you just ask, all right?  Us? That Red Jenny... thing. I didn't mean--  No one needs to see my arse.  (if in party (Laughs  Oh?  Not convinced?  And you know this because?  You're talking about the fruit, right?  Please, tell me you're talking about the fruit.  For the Wardens, battle is a sacred duty, a vigil kept to guard the world against destruction. It's not a game.  Do heads count?  Then... three.  So, if I were to convert to the Qun, what place would I have in your society?  And if I don't?  Laborer?  Right. I'll pass.  Thanks.  Isn't that exactly what we're doing? Right this minute? More or less?  Have you considered incorporating headbutts into your fighting style?  Too easy for enemies to defend against?  Nicely done.  Ah. Point taken. So to speak.  Well, many famous Warden blades were made from Silverite. It seems to work well on darkspawn.  And you? Clearly a man who enjoys a good blade. Bloodstone, perhaps?  Dawnstone? That's even more brittle than Bloodstone.  It's pink.  What? Me?  Can't a man think without being judged for it?  A tragedy, for sure.  What benefits?  (sighs  How do you think?  I suppose I see the similarity, when you put it like that.  Yes.  Is there a reason for the interrogation?  Few are.  Don't the horns make it hard to lie down? How do you sleep?  I'm surprised you don't wear heavier armor on your blind side.  That can't work every time.  You sacrificed your own men.  Your men trusted you. You betrayed that trust when you left them to die.  No?  Not unless you ask me to hold a hill, Qunari.  So, Bull, how does it feel to be Tal-Vashoth?  Calm down, I meant no offense.  As you say, I know something of being cut off from a past life, having to find a new way.  In any event, you have the Chargers. You haven't lost everything.  It's a difficult thing you've done, turning your back on one life to live another. You could look at it as opening a way forward, not closing the way back.  In any event, you have the Chargers. You haven't lost everything.  And you'd be my boss.  And a mercenary. I'm done with that part of my life.  I’d rather fight for a cause.  I’d rather fight for a cause.  And exchanging it for the burden of everyone hating me? Yes. So much better.  Why don't we hit a few bottles first, huh?  And now...?  I grew a beard.  And I didn't talk to anyone for months at the time.  (Coughs.  It's fine.  (Sighs.  It's not easy finding people willing to shoulder such a terrible responsibility.  That's what you think of the Wardens?  They are men and women, atoning for what they've done by giving of themselves. They fight for people like you. People in silks and velvets. Who talk... and judge.  I know your kind.  I know that what comes out of your mouth is the same drivel that comes out of theirs.  Careful I don't club you on the head.  You need never worry about being worthy, trust me.  You have something to say, mage?  That's it? I'd expect more from a man who can't stop talking about how clever he is.  Better that than a pompous brat.  Well, I'm a man.  (grumble I apologize, Inquisitor.  How do you get your hair to do that, Dorian? With magic?  Dorian, do you think we could ever be friends?  If you really cared, you could ask.  Oh, but wait. That would involve talking to a dirty commoner like me.  I'm sure you're mistaken.  Why?  Then you'd be better served giving me a word puzzle.  Not a chance.  Corypheus. One of yours, isn't he?  Is he or is he not a Tevinter Magister?  Certainly feels that way at times.  Dorian, I would prefer if you stopped referring to me as “that hairy lummox.”  The tavern, the smithy, the servants... You said it to the gate guards as we left Skyhold!  It's odd how you've won over so many at Skyhold, Dorian.  Never. You're more the "spoiled prince," and I question your reasons for being here.  I find that difficult to believe.  It’s interesting watching you, Dorian. The way you carry yourself when you use magic.  No, it’s not that. You find joy in it, not shame. And it shows.  Something we “southerners” need to learn, perhaps?  We were having a moment, and now you’ve ruined it.  I understand you were asking about me and the Inquisitor at Skyhold, Dorian.  I'm not certain I do. Why the interest?  Leave. It. Be.  I was unsure I'd heard correctly.  I would not pry into the Inquisitor's business.  No. Thank you.  Dorian, I can't believe you drank that swill at the tavern.  Then why did you drink it?  Or you're a drunkard with terrible taste.  Word of what happened in Redcliffe had better not spread.  You think mages will be better off if people know they can change the future?  Then you should not give them more.  It is not the same thing and you know it.  I've seen ruins like this all over Thedas. There's thousands out there.  Some must have been bigger than proper cities like Denerim or Val Royeaux.  Beg pardon?  Oh, this should be good.  Too hard on myself? Is this setting up a punchline?  Here it comes.  I'm not sure how to respond.  Are you speaking to me?  "Blackwall" will do.  Is that so?  You... did not have to apologize to me, Dorian.  I am indeed a murderer. And I escaped my past to become a warden, like many others before me.  And you you abandoned your life of privilege for the sake of principle alone.  It was wrong of me to lump you in with peers you hardly resemble.  Gladly.  They say you're a demon.  Either way, I know you're dangerous.  What?  Fine, so you're dangerous and insane.  But the start was so cheery.  At the ball? It's Orlesian culture, get used to it.  Wait.  How do you know that song?  Look, ask Varric. He seems to have adopted you.  No, it's a beard. Look, if you were any other lad your age I'd tell that one day you'll probably grow one too. Except I don't know if spirits that become boys get beards.  Right. You go do that then. Good luck. Have fun.  This thing you do? Maybe you should stop doing it.  Go bother Solas.  (Laughs. It's a sword.  And now you've made it awkward.  How does a spirit become flesh anyway?  You know, Cole, you're not so bad. But I'll never get used to the things that come out of your mouth.  A perfect example.  What are you staring at?  Hey, Cole. Say something interesting.  Yes, I deserved that one.  Ideally. That's why my armor's heavier than yours.  What are you talking about, Cole?  Maker's balls, get out of my mind, would you? You make me sound like a dirty, old bastard!  No.  Why are you here? Do you even understand what's happening in the world?  But you've killed before.  Why should we believe you can help now?  Maker's balls.  Tell me, Cole, how do you make them forget you?  That's not right.  What isn't my fault?  Angry? Really? I thought I was just imagining all the frowning faces. Care to tear into me as well, now that you know?  You, who heal the helpless... you're not angry about what I was hiding?  Stop. Please.  Cole, if you knew what I am, what I'd done, why didn't you tell the others?  I'm a murderer.  If only that were possible.  I suppose I do.  I hear you found the templar that hurt you.  Did it?  Good. Remembering is the only way you learn.  It does.  So now that you've dealt with the templar, you're a real boy?  Good enough. I suppose you'll stop looking into people's heads soon? And you might want to look into, I don't know, eating.  Oh, are we at that stage? Spitting everything up? At least you've mastered walking.  Soon you'll be eating properly. Then drinking. Then drinking for real. Then girls.  You're supposed to stop looking in my head.  What do you think your templar is doing now? Trying to make a new life for himself?  What?  (Sighs. We are a pair, you and I. The victim and the murderer.  I believe I can work with that.  I hear you found the Templar that killed you.  Just like that? How do you forgive someone who does that to you?  He deserved to be punished.  This Templar who hurt you... you made him forget?  Why did you do that? You shouldn't have taken that from him.  Taking away a bad memory is one thing. Taking away guilt is another. Without that guilt, it's as though he never killed you.  I... I don't know.  I... Yes. Perhaps.  But now he doesn't remember what he did.  (Sighs. We are a pair, you and I. The victim and the murderer. If it helps you, lad, then I am glad you forgave him.  Thank you.  The honor is mine, Lady Seeker.  Righteous? High praise, Cassandra. Many Wardens have hardly lived righteous lives.  That is the hope.  You had a brother?  I had a sister. A younger sister. She died when I was very little.  I often think about what she'd be like now, had she lived.  Maker, I wouldn't wish that on her. All this hair?  I had a sister. A younger sister. She died when I was very little.  I have no more reason to lie, Cassandra. I often wonder what she’d be like now, had she lived.  Hitting is better than quiet rage?  Could you be a little more gentle the next time we spar, Cassandra?  Yes, but I'd rather not.  Bruised glass, thank you.  I notice you seem to focus yourself before battle, Cassandra.  I tell myself, "It's them or you. And if it's you, be damn sure to take the bastards with you."  Crude, yes, but it works.  "Traitor" is not an easy title to escape.  I wasn't there, Cassandra.  You joined the Seekers when you were young, did you not?  So you knew what you wanted, even if you didn't get it.  That's good. Some of us take much longer to find our place.  It's the usual story.  A tavern? A chance meeting? A Senior Warden who saw worth in a worthless man? I'm not alone.  No, you don't want to hear it.  Cassandra.  Seeker Cassandra--  What happened to "It's never too late to become more than what you are"?  Celestine Black, they call it. It's the only stone I'll use on my blades.  You know what? Keep it. I'll find another.  Of course.  So...  Nothing. Just enjoying the comfortable silence.  I miss our sparring matches Cass̶an- Seeker Cassandra.  You were a worthy opponent.  I don’t much fancy a concussion.  So you were the Right Hand of the Divine, and Leliana the Left?  Me? No, I would never make such a terrible joke.  They say your family almost drove the dragons to extinction.  A shame. Majestic beasts.  Is it true that Leliana knows everything about everyone?  You encourage it?  Right. Good to know.  You mean me?  It’s just a slight sprain, should be fine by tomorrow. I…appreciate your concern.  Thank you, Seeker Cassandra.  Love suits you Cassandra.  You seem to be smiling a great deal more than usual, or am I mistaken?  And the sidelong glances at the Inquisitor?  The humming?  Then apparently I should better protect my head.  Such spite is beneath you Cassandra.  I…wasn’t…  I…Of course. You’re right.  As you wish, Seeker.  I’m sorry about your apprentice.  It must be difficult to-  I don’t, and I didn’t know him, but it seems we lost a good Seeker.  Quite a handful then.  Sounds like a fine young man.  He does? We just met.  Right.  Well…Alistair’s a good man, he helped end the Blight, and Duncan’s the sort even he would look up to.  Why do you want me there?  You knew him as well as I did Cassandra…but I will pay my respects.  You find me reserved?  I was aiming for aloof.  The other day, did I see you punch a tree? What did it ever do to you?  I see…  The direct approach (Chuckles, I like it.  It’s… from everywhere. I traveled a lot in my youth.  They’re quiet. I like having time to myself.  They’re only horses.
