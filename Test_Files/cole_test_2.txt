She has to reach the other side of the hill.  The Knight-Captain. But she's injured.  ...I don't know. The hill went away.  Yes. It makes me tired, and doesn't work if they're loud. Or angry. Or bright.  Maybe. Like what?  They were staring at me.  In Skyhold. The servants in the courtyard. They were looking at me and whispering.  What's wrong with my hat?  Should I change my hat?  A silk shirt with three buttons left undone.  My shoelaces keep coming untied.  Can you talk to them? They don't listen to me.  I like travelling with Dwarves.  You're quiet, but the old song still echoes inside, almost like templars.  But he died at the end of the last book. If he comes back, the readers will be confused.  It was the shape that would help.  It had to be him. But harmless. The him he wanted that wouldn't hurt.  He didn't need me.  What would I learn? I can hear when they need me.  I'll... try.  How do you make them calm?  Everyone. You talk and the fear fades, slipping to sleep. Not always happy, but not angry.  Cats swat my feet even when no one can see me.  "If you don't get some sunshine, you'll wilt." She says she's not a plant, she's fine, but falling, faltering, foolish. Blood on her hands, people and demons always end in trouble. Too many Daisies in this garden.  I am good, Varric. I am me. You don't need to worry... but thank you for caring.  The heft in my hands, solid, strong, but curving, careful, like her. Soot smudge on her cheek. Tiny scars on her fingers, old fires. Her little frown when she twists a gear ever so slightly.  Your stories aren't real. But then people read them and they are!  So many people reading, dreaming, feeling. Spirits spill around the veil making shapes. Reality from writing!  Do you write to reach across? To hear the song that was sundered?  Does she use a big sword, or a sword and shield?  "The next time you imagine him touching you, someone you love will die."  She knows who he is. Does it not work for your book?  Two pairs beats one pair. Four of a kind beats two pairs. She slips the ace of dragons into a thigh-high boot, calls to the barman for another round. Blondie stares at the table, angry, always angry.  Do they ever stop talking to you?  The people in your head. They aren't real, but they have voices and thoughts and sometimes you see through their eyes.  I think I have it. Let me try again.  Knock, knock.  Cole.  It's me, Cole. That is my name.  Knock, knock.  The Inquisition.  That's who we are, Varric?  Knock, knock.  Me.  Me. And I'm telling a knock knock joke.  No? I go where the knife needs to be.  Knock, knock.  Dragon.  Dragons really don't like wyverns.  You do think about it a lot.  Solas doesn't fear spirits, Vivienne. Why do you?  The Circle makes you afraid? Are the demons stronger there?  Solas is my friend!  I have a body. And Solas has nothing to fear from me. Neither do you... unless you attack first. I like the Fade, but I can help here. I could help you if you let me.  I can't return to the Fade. Sometimes I wish I could.  You're afraid. You don't have to be.  She's afraid!  Everything bright, roar of anger as the demon rears. No, I will not fall. No one will control me ever again.  Flash of white as the world comes back. Shaking, hollow, Harrowed, but smiling at templars to show them I'm me.  I am not like that. I can protect you. If templars come for you, I will kill them.  Stepping into the parlor, hem of my gown snagged, no, adjust before I go in, must look perfect.  Voices inside. Marquis Alphonse.  "I do hope Duke Bastien puts out the lights before he touches her. But then, she must disappear in the dark."  Gown tight between my fingers, cold all over. Unacceptable. Wheels turn, strings pull.  He hurt you. You left a letter, let out a lie so he would do something foolish against the Inquisition. A trap.  Nugs are kind, Almost everything is bigger than they, but they're still happy.  If you hold out your hand, they will nuzzle it. It's how they call you "friend."  Nugs aren't dangerous.  Grass doesn't mind anything. People walk on it, horses eat it, it's always content.  Do you feel spirits move around you when you cast a spell?  Bits of them push through with your magic, tiny, a wisp of a wisp, free before falling back. They pool around you, water in a cup, defined, deafened, hearing only your song.  They want to skate, scintillate on skin. You made them. Their Maker.  Are you still afraid of me, Vivienne?  Dorian is like you, Vivienne.  The Veil sings around both of you. It whispers through you and makes you both brighter.  No. For most mages, it's a tool. A
