  Smuggling? That is certainly a... unique use of a spirit's innate power of persuasion.  Varric, you joined the Inquisition when seeker Pentaghast questioned you?  Interesting.  It surprised me that an elven apostate is the one who joined the Inquisition voluntarily.  By the end of Hard in Hightown, almost every character is revealed as a spy or a traitor.  It was in the Inquisition library. Everyone but Donnen turned out to be in disguise. Is that common?  Are there many tricksters in dwarven literature?  Curious.  What would the Inquisition do without our stabilizing influence, Master Tethras?  That does sound like most humans I know.  Before you cause everything to explode.  Varric, you fought Corypheus once before?  And you killed him. You were certain of his death?  He survived the explosion that destroyed the Conclave.  If he can live through a blast that levels a mountaintop, we would do well to determine how.  As much as is possible. The Fade contains a wealth of knowledge for those who know where to look.  So are humans, but we continue to interact with them... when we must.  It's comforting that whatever qualities I lack, you'll invent for me, Varric.  When you put it like that, I must concede your point.  Is it true that the entire dwarven economy relies upon lyrium?  And the dwarves of Orzammar have never studied lyrium?  It is the source of all magic, save that which mages bring themselves.  Dwarves alone have the ability to mine it safely. I wondered if they had sought to learn more.  Do you ever miss life beneath the earth? The call of the Stone?  But... do you miss it?  You are wiser than most.  I find the fall of the dwarven lands confusing.  A great deal, although that is a different matter. Dwarves control the flow of lyrium. They could tighten their grip on it.  You're active in the Carta. You know your people could tug the purse strings. You could claim sovereign land on the surface, or demand help restoring the dwarven kingdom, but you don't.  Is there at least a movement to reunite Orzammar and Kal-Sharok?  Once, in the Fade, I saw the memory of a man who lived alone on an island. Most of his tribe had fallen to beasts or disease. His wife had died in childbirth. He was the only one left. He could have struck out on his own to find a new land, new people. But he stayed. He spent every day catching fish in a little boat, every night drinking fermented fruit juice and watching the stars.  How can you be happy surrendering, knowing it will all end with you? How can you not fight?  So it seems.    I've no idea what you mean.  And you have no concept of what that difference cost you.  You truly are content to sit in the sun, never wondering what you could've been, never fighting back.  How does passively accepting your fate constitute a fight?  Yes.  Well said. Perhaps I was mistaken.  That crossbow is remarkable, Varric. I am surprised the dwarves have not made more of them.  Indeed. I am surprised, not disappointed.  I have heard your books are very popular, Master Tethras.  I am glad of it.  We live in a dark and angry time, child of Stone. So much of what people believe has come crashing down.  If you bring them a little peace with the worlds you make between the pages, you have done more than most.  I'm not much of a gambler anymore.  What do you play for?  The Grey Wardens allow elves and dwarves into their ranks?  A pity they do it so badly then.  Argue if you like, your fight against the darkspawn is noble, but what progress have you made?  They've bought us some time, I will grant them that.  They seemed unaccustomed to seeing elves without servant's livery... or dwarves at all.  Are you planning a chapter filled with courtly intrigue?  I don't always mention the Veil.  How unfortunate for me.  Well said Cole. Although I doubt she will ever accept.  Ignore her Cole. She would hurt what she does not understand.  That is correct, Enchanter. I did not train in your Circle.  I will try, in my own fumbling way, to learn from how you helped seal the rifts at Haven.  Ah, wait. My memory misleads me. You were not there.  Your rigorous training lays a solid foundation, true. It also creates boundaries, limits, where none need exist.  Of course. You endured the Harrowing, where your Circle teaches you that all demons attempt to possess you.  Why should I? You would not believe me. You have learned your lessons all too well.  Nothing unexpected, given the energies emanating from the rifts. And you, Enchanter?  Do you require a mana cleansing to remove the residual energies on your staff?  So you intend for your staff to carry that particular aura?  No, no. As you were.  I will. Perhaps you will direct me to a Circle mage who does not front-load her barriers?  Oh, I look forward to this. Go ahead, Enchanter.  Perhaps what you perceived was merely a figment of the Fade.  It did go out eventually. It was not worth mentioning.  Tell me, Enchanter. Do you even bother to explore the Fade in your dreams?  Pity. You could be much more powerful if you ventured outside your narrow preconceptions.  Enchanter, any pride demon you met would just walk away, shaking its head and laughing uncontrollably.  The fact that I, an apostate, have not been enslaved by demons must be quite vexing, Enchanter.  You flatter me.  Yes, packing all the mages into towers and threatening them with Templars certainly kept them safe.  Your Circle was a tightly clamped lid on a boiling pot. It held for a while, and, unless you looked inside, it all seemed fine. And everyone feigned surprise when it finally burst.  My rebels? Am I an agent for their cause, whispering poison into the Inquisition's ears?  How comforting.  No more than any other clever man who wonders what he could do if pushed.  But I meant you, Enchanter. How comforting it must be for you to see a traitor helping the rebels from within.  You need never concern yourself with the possibility that your Circle was wrong.  I planted no seeds in your garden, Enchanter. You grew that fruit yourself.  While mages live in depravation you do not share? You lord their mystique over those not so gifted. Well played, Enchanter. In another age you might have ruled an empire.  Yes.  I would kill them. Magic is more elegant than a blade or a bow, but a murderer remains a murderer.  I am certain they would. Until black and white distinctions perverted their simple minds.  Do enjoy this time, Enchanter. You may miss your freedom when you lock yourself back up in some tower.  You so often come out on top. You play the political games brilliantly.  You could use those skills to improve the lives of your fellow mages. Instead you have done nothing, save consolidate your own power.  You honestly believe the world is better off with you setting its course?  Then Enchanter, I leave you with the greatest curse of my people. Dirthara-ma.  "May you learn."  Your position in the Orlesian court must be frustrating, Enchanter.  With your magic you are kept at arm's length, never able to play the Game to its fullest. Some part of you must always wonder if you could have gone farther had you not been a mage.  That must rankle as well.  It was fascinating to observe you at the Winter Palace, Enchanter.  It is all pagentry, Enchanter.  Such mistakes are opportunities in disguise. Nobles say things around servants they would never say to Cassandra, or the Inquisitor.  My apologies. I shall try to live down to your expectations.  I never claimed mages should be above the law, Enchanter.  The false Calling was blight magic. The demon merely amplified its power.  And one of the glasses is poisoned.  Every intelligent creature should.  Blood magic is no worse than any other. Properly used. But the blight...  The blight corrupts everything it touches. Those who believe themselves capable of using it safely are mad.  Then that explains why we saw no old men at Adamant.  Why should those ruins please me, Enchanter?  I always knew, Enchanter. The Temple of Mythal is just another reminder of what was lost.  For once, we agree. Many relics were lost for good reason.  When I awaken each morning, all I have with me are those secrets.  The power at the Temple of Mythal is tangible, potent... and far too easy to misuse.  Only a fool would ignore such a stark reminder of the destruction of an empire.  We may disagree on many things, Enchanter. But neither of us is a fool.  I looked.  This world is full of wonders for those who seek them.  No, we have another name for it.  You spend too much time with Sera.  You haven't seen many elves then.  I don't. Everything in the Fade is a memory and memories are all too easily muddied. Just like your history books, they contain truths, but reason and sense are required to extract it.  Thank you. The death itself was less painful than what came before.  Seeing a good spirit twisted, its nature defiled.  Those mages knew nothing of my friend. Worse, they did not care.  Nor will you, until you've seen ignorance snatch away all that you love.  Pray such a day never finds you.  (Sighs. Sera's involved? So this question will be offensive.  Oh, for... really?!  For a twelve-year-old!  Nothing about the Fade or spirits is simple, especially not that.  I did not say that.  Ass.  You have seen a great deal of battle.  Not all, not like you. You live and breathe war. You understand it. It is home to you.  I intended no offense.  We have both seen terrible things. We have watched death and destruction render that which we love unrecognizable.  It is calming to see something familiar in another.  The distortion of time? I have seen magic accomplish many things, but ... no, that is new.  Many mages are brutes, seeing nothing more than a larger ball of fire.  But those with imagination, those who use war to push the limits of the possible ...  Such rules never hold. Any who want victory will find some reason their cause merits exception.  The best we can do is ensure the world still stands when this fight ends.  They were templars.  It is not looking down upon them to recognize what they are.  Some, like Ser Barris, are thoughtful soldiers doing what they believe is right.  The rest? Younger sons, petty criminals, thugs, bullies, orphans...  Either they are accustomed to a life without choices, to following even the worst orders...  Or they have learned to enjoy causing pain, to leap at any chance to swing a sword harder.  The Val Royeaux market was once nothing but tents of oiled leather and mud. Filled with ragged humans selling strings of beads made of bone.  Yes. I left that memory quickly. The smell...  Oh yes. It's much better now. I enjoy the frilly cakes.  Your Order... the Grey Wardens...  Of course, but you may still have an answer.  The Wardens see themselves as the world's defense against the Blight, do they not?  When an Archdemon rises, they slay it. What will they do when all the Archdemons are slain?  Without Archdemons, there can be no Blights. Is that the reasoning?  Nowhere. I hope they are correct.  A mage?  I heard you in the training yard this morning.  No, no... It's fine. Children don't learn unless you shout at them.  Survive the first thirty heartbeats, and you'll have already won.  I mean that demons are rarely intelligent enough to change their tactics. If you focus on defending yourself, you will see the full range of their abilities within the first thirty heartbeats. By then, you should be able to find a weakness and exploit it.  Also, try not to die.  There are struggles across Thedas at any given time. I doubt you would have heard of it.  In a manner of speaking. You?  I do indeed.  You should have seen me when I was younger. Hot-blooded and cocky, always ready to fight.  It is a delicate balance for those who fight.  If they lack sufficient passion, they never become truly skilled, and die or leave the life.  Yes. It is a rare soldier who can fight without letting it define him.  There is little to say. I assumed we were alike. We'd seen war, knew its terrible costs, but understood that it was necessary. But there was nothing necessary in what you did. You did not survive death and destruction. You sowed them. To feed your own desires.  By wearing another skin. You ran away rather than face what you had done. You wasted your time.  I wish to apologize for what I said to you, Blackwall.  My people had a saying long ago - "The healer has the bloodiest hands." You cannot treat a wound without knowing how deep it goes. You cannot heal pain by hiding it. You must accept. Accept the blood to make things better. You have taken the first step. That is the hardest part.  I will remember this. When it is over.  The people. How you fought against the tide. It is... courageous.  So, you and the Inquisitor are together.  Far from it. People should seize any chance for a moment's respite in times such as these. I am glad you've allowed yourself some happiness.  I would be concerned if you forgot your past, but that seems unlikely. Beyond that, guilt is a distraction. One we can ill afford.  I find my peace elsewhere.  For the most part.  People can be trying, mankind most of all.  Why? The Breach remains a threat to us all.  Ah, because I am an apostate. I might flee before the Inquisition throws me in chains?  I take my commitments seriously, Seeker. Come what may, I shall see this through.  Did you believe the Conclave could achieve peace, Cassandra?  The templars went to war to force mages back into their Circles, which the mages would never agree to. What solution could Divine Justinia have offered when all sides rejected compromise?  Or they believed the other side would relent.  It is a comfort to have you present on our journeys, Seeker.  Manners, perhaps?  I say what I believe to be true, even if it gives offense to those who prefer the lie. But there is no lie in what you are. Your position is an honorable one, and well-earned.  I went to see the Breach for myself. I did not know you would be there.  I was not. I'd come to hear of the Conclave, but did not want to get close.  It is as though you are drawing upon the world around us. Mages draw forth the essence of the fade, and use that essence to shape reality.  In a manner of speaking. You reinforce reality so it's less mutable. The fade has nowhere to gain a foothold, and the magic disperses.  You are a seeker of truth.  I am pleased you find it so.  Your abilities declare the world real. Who, if not the Maker of this world, could grant such a gift?  I am always open to new ideas.  Seeker, you initially believed our "Herald of Andraste" was involved in the attack on the Conclave, yes?  Yet you changed your mind.  Sadly, yes. Too few invested with authority possess the courage to alter their course.  They fear the appearance of weakness.  Your abilities are remarkable, Seeker. It is fascinating to see how you and the templars negate magic.  Only at a distance. I am an apostate, after all.  I am a very careful apostate.  You fight hard, Seeker.  I admire your optimism, but ask yourself honestly how the templars would have reacted.  There is no doubt in my mind. My studies threaten established ideas. I would never have been tolerated.  Would there be more like you, Seeker.  Are your own memories any different? The truth is never precise, regardless of where you are.  So, Seeker, your Inquisition grows.  You did the brutal, thankless work putting the wheels in motion.  Do you feel no regret at letting that power pass to another?  You surprise me again, Seeker.  Not low, but realistic. Very few, however honorable, release power they have won.  Cause and effect. Wisdom as its own reward, and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist.  I know. I believe the elven gods existed, as did the old gods of Tevinter. But I do not think any of them were gods, unless you expand the definition of the word to the point of absurdity. I appreciate the idea of your Maker, a god that does not need to prove his power. I wish more such gods felt the same.  I have people, Seeker. The greatest triumphs and tragedies this world has known can all be traced to people.  Most Dalish would agree with you--- and see little value in doing so.  It was done in a... private moment, I would rather not discuss it.  I expect you are correct.  I will be pleased when the world we share is not threatened by a blight-corrupted madman.  That is the likely result, yes.  If I were to be shackled, you would have done so by now. I am an asset, if not a friend.  I may disagree with the Inquisition's choices, but such concerns pale in comparison to the threat we face.  That is the likely result, yes.  If I were to be shackled, you would have done so by now. I am an asset, if not a friend.  I may disagree with the Inquisition's choices, but such concerns pale in comparison to the threat we face.  Regardless of who was responsible, the conflict between Templars and mages helped Corypheus rise to power.  We cannot afford to let political infighting distract us from our duty.  Thank you, Seeker. I think.  One assumes that if it were, we would be facing a Blight.  It is connected to Corypheus. Such a relation goes beyond mere control - it is a bond.  I would not go as far as that. This dragon is a replica, spawned from a creature who aspires to greatness. No more.  A darkspawn, as he appears.  His true advantage is the red lyrium. It is corrupted by the Blight as he is, thus taps into its power twofold.  Whatever he was before, that is what makes him dangerous now.  How are you feeling, Cassandra, after the revelations about your Seekers?  Now that you know them corrupt, you must determine which parts of yourself to discard and which to keep.  I would hardly presume. In our travels, I have been impressed by your honesty and your faith. It is a difficult path, Seeker, but if anyone can walk it honorably, you can.  No? They are an organization.  Given enough time, yes. To survive, an organization must devote resources to maintaining itself. Those resources inevitably accumulate until the original purpose, however pure, is all but lost.  A beast, no matter how mindless, will die and give way to a successor. An organization is eternal. There are always corrupt men who hoard power for their own gain and there are always honorable men who hoard power to fight them.  I did hear of what you learned, yes.  They would be a danger to themselves and others, yes.  It is difficult to say. In your Vigil, you were Tranquil for but a moment. They have suffered much longer.  Such control is like a muscle, atrophying without use. Given time it might be restored, but until then...  They will be grateful... even the ones who do not survive.  You seem troubled, Seeker. Still plagued by thoughts of your order?  Do you know how rare spirits of faith are? How difficult it is to draw them to this world? You should be proud, having accomplished something so remarkable, not ashamed it was not what you thought.  Your faith does you credit, Cassandra. I hope your Maker is worthy.  They are fools, a fact only amplified by Corypheus' meddling.  If you are looking for certainty, Cassandra, I cannot help you.  Then spirit or no, her actions were worthy of respect.  Thank you.  Not similar, Seeker. The same. The Chantry sees black and white, but nature is, and always has been, grey. A spirit is a purpose. A demon is that purpose perverted.  Survival. Satiation. The pleasure of taste, of feeding. True hunger, however, is much darker. Think of all those who starve in this world. Mankind has itself to blame for the existence of demons.  It is worse this time, with the Breach pulling spirits through against their will... But, yes. Every war, no matter how just, leads to hunger and rage... and so come the demons.  The deaths, the rage - all of it weakens the Veil. But nothing is ever said of the effect war has upon the world of spirits, what we might be doing to them. Every war has unintended victims. All too many go unnoticed.  I visit the Fade regularly. Perhaps you are sensing traces of it.  You are a spirit who crossed the Veil and took human form.  The two are not so dissimilar, Cole.  While the world may exert a pull in one direction or another, the choice is ultimately yours.  It's a mild tremor in the Veil. Nothing to worry about. Focus on what is here, in this world.  Feel the ground, the breath in your lungs, fabric rustling against your skin.  It's nothing. It can be overwhelming for anyone.  How go your attempts to ease the pain of those at Skyhold, Cole?  No. You exist to help others. You are kindness, compassion, caring. If you stop giving comfort, you would twist into something else, as you did before I suspect.  Good. Never forget your purpose. It is a noble one, even if this world does not understand.  Unless I have something to say, yes.  How small the pain of one man seems when weighed against the endless depths of memory, of feeling, of existence. That ocean carries everyone. And those of us who learn to see its currents move through life with their fewer ripples.  And I never said that there was not.  I apologize for disturbing you, Cole. I am not a spirit, and sometimes it is hard to remember such simple truths.  I know.  I know that as well.  A mistake. One of many made by a much younger elf who was certain he knew everything.  Thank you, Cole.  It is no bother, Inquisitor. Cole is a spirit of compassion and this world is too bleak to spurn compassion offered freely. I will never know that for certain, Cole, but thank you for saying it.  Thank you, Cole.  There are few. Spirits form as a reflection of this world and its passions.  We will never lack for spirits of rage, or hunger, or desire. The world gives them plenty to mirror.  The gentler spirits are far more rare. We can ill afford the loss of even one spirit of wisdom, or faith...  Or compassion.  Do that, please.  I do not need you to do that, Cole.  (Sighs Could you... if you would remember her, could you do it as I would?  Thank you.  Not until the Veil is healed. The rifts draw spirits through, and the shock makes demons of them.  Yes, exactly. Deliberately crossing the Veil requires that a spirit form will, personality.  That concept of self gives a spirit the chance to maintain its nature.  Wrenched into this world unwillingly by the rifts, spirits suffer the same fate as my friend.  No. It is a mistake to ascribe human motivations to them.  You are always you.  How do you feel, Cole, now that you dealt with the Templar?  You may well become fully human, after all. I never thought to see it.  I did not say that I had.  Good luck, Cole. You have taken a difficult road.  How do you feel, Cole? Are you...  I see. I... let me know if I can help.  Are you well, Cole?  I am glad to hear it.  I am fine, thank you. There are others who need your help more urgently.  Do you wish you can return to the Fade, Cole?  Yet, you remain.  Then for as long as you remain, I am glad of your company.  I had no choice.  I had no choice.  You cannot heal this, Cole. Please, let it go.  I apologize, Cole. That is not a pain you can heal.  It was my doing, not yours.  She did not need a Chantry, she needed to remember her faith.  They are always attracted to the world of the living.  We all have a face we want to show, and a face we we do not.  Ah, yes.  That is one interpretation, yes.  I think he fell, and it held him as he died, leaving him with images that told him his life was worthwhile.  When they possess people, they often indulge in feelings they have never before experienced.  Have you felt no interest in women since you came through the Veil?  People say they lack the ability to learn or grow.  But the more contact you have with this world, the more ability you gain.  It isn't about right and wrong. It's about attention, when you think you have been forgotten.  It would be a terrible thing.  How could they not?  Competition brings passion, Cole, and passion lets people attach import to trivial things.  People wish to accomplish the truly great things on their own.  They did. The boy got a family.  The wise must sometimes give people what they need, not what they want.  It is easier for people to believe that they were tricked into making terrible decisions.  Often a problem, yes.  It will make little sense unless one has spent more time in the Fade.  Well said.  I'm pleased you're enjoying yourself.  That is a matter of perspective.  True.  You are a rare soul, master Tethras.  I do.  So I've been told.  The Tevinter Imperium is not the safest place for an elf.  No. They are intelligent, living creatures. Binding them against their will is reprehensible.  Hmm  And any that show any magical talent are freed, are they not?  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about your slaves.  If you have, why would it concern you?  My abilities as a mage.  The differences between us are not technicalities to be discarded, Dorian.  Yes. The effect clears magical energy and creates a minor randomized barrier to impair incoming magic.  The technique is not Tevinter. It is elven.  But do go on about the wonders of Tevinter magic.  I am surprised you do not practice blood magic, Dorian. Is it not popular in Tevinter?  Tevinter lore about elves remains accurate as always.  I'm sorry?  No.  Dorian... hush.  Empires rise and fall. Arlathan was no more "innocent" than your own Tevinter in its time.  Your nostalgia for the ancient elves, however romanticized, is pointless.  If you wish to make amends for past transgressions, free the slaves of all races who live in Tevinter today.  Then how sorry are you?  I notice you used a nullification enchantment combined with an offensive attack.  Don't you then waste an inordinate amount of magic overcoming your own nullification?  Of course. Have you considering snapping the Veil-warp to enhance the relative energy?  You think that is an achievement of which to be proud?  In all of human history.  Perhaps it's best it remain that way.  Is that a problem for you?  Your magical skill is impressive, Dorian.  Would you not conserve magical energy with a less... flashy... style, however?  Please speak up! I cannot hear you over your outfit!  I believe so. Why do you ask?  Perhaps. The humans of ancient times took much from the elves.  I'm pleased we were not forced to kill them, if that's what you mean.  Perhaps Abelas will do that.  You are still troubled by what you learned at the temple, Dorian.  You think they would not accept the truth?  Iron Bull. I understand that among your people, you are... what is the term?  You spied upon your own people.  What they say and do, yes. Not what they think.  No. Even the lowliest peasant may find freedom in the safety of her thoughts. You take even that.  Surely, even you see, Iron Bull, that freedom is preferable to mindless obedience to the Qun.  You think Orlais and Ferelden would be better off under Qunari rule?  Do not equivocate. Would we or would we not be better under the Qun?  It absolutely is.  Happy? No. Quite the opposite.  No. You said this world would be brighter if all thinking individuals were stripped of individuality.  You only lack the will to get more blood on your hands.  It doesn't matter if they are happy, it matters that they may choose!  Yes! If a Ferelden servant decides that his life goal is to... become a poet, he can follow that dream!  It may be difficult, and he might fail. But the whole of society is not aligned to oppose him!  Almost none! What does that matter?  Your Qun would crush the brilliant few for the mediocre many!  If your Qun is so wonderful, so fair and perfect, how does it create so many Tal-Vashoth?  There are enough of them to marry and have children, like the man/woman we travel with!  It isn't a sickness. You are losing them because they see a chance for freedom!  And most of them are "savage," as you say, because your culture taught them nothing else.  They know nothing but the Qun. So even as they fight against it, they are guided by its principles.  You fought the Tal-Vashoth for a long time, Iron Bull, did you not?  No man can kill so many people without breaking inside. To survive... those you fight must become monsters.  The mind does marvelous things to protect itself.  Yes. The Fade holds a trove of memories to explore. Spirits know secrets lost to this world.  Would many not say the same of the Qunari?  Instead, you conquer them and turn them into servants of the Qun.  What do you mean?  I might scold you? Berate you for your decisions?  I never said otherwise.  The truth is, Iron Bull, you are Qunari. I cannot be disappointed in your decisions.  As a mindless, soulless drone, you could never make any.  You are not Tal-Vashoth, Iron Bull, not really.  No more then our Inquisitor, who's parents left the Qun before he/she was born.  You are no beast, snapping under the stress of the Qun's harsh discipline.  You are a man who made a choice... possibly the first of your life.  You have the Inquisition, you have the Inquisitor... and you have me.  Iron Bull, how do your people put on shirts?  Colorful.  I suppose.  Unless the fight is personal, violence is a means to an end. It isn't appropriate to celebrate.  We have fought living men, with loves and families, and all that they might have been is gone.  Hmm.  A man in the last village. Something in his manner troubles me.  Why do you say that?  You are more observant than you appear.  That comes from being self-taught.  I discovered most magic on my own, or learned it from my journeys in the Fade.  Or without magical training, you cannot notice the parts of my magic that "clunk".  No. Such behavior attracts the attention of demons.  How do you feel, Iron Bull? Do you need a distraction to focus your mind?  King's pawn to E4.  Too complicated for a savage Tal-Vashoth?  Pawn to F4. King's Gambit.  So, where were we? Ah, yes. Mage to C4.  Speaking of aggressive. I assume Arishok is your term for the Queen? King to F1.  All right. You have my curiosity. Mage takes Pawn.  You call your Knights Ben-Hassrath? Incidentally, Knight to F3.  Pawn to D3.  All right, Bull. If you are prepared  Neither. Knight to F5.  And you, your Knight. Or Ben-Hassrath, if you will. Pawn to G4.  Hmm. Tower to G1.  I get the idea.  We shall see.  If you have a moment, Bull  Pawn to H5. Careful.  Queen to F3.  Mage takes Pawn, threatens Queen.  Knight to C3. You've developed nothing but your Queen.  Hmm. I will need to consider.  After careful consideration  Mage to D6.  King to E2.  Pawn to E5.  Think about it, my friend.  Knight takes Pawn at G7. Check.  Queen to F6, Check.  Mage to E7. Checkmate.  And you as well, Tal-Vashoth.  I shall take that as a compliment.  No. And I would prefer not to discuss it.  You joined the Qun.  And put you into something worse.  A slave may always struggle for freedom, but you among the Qun have been taught not to think.  No. Wait... No.  We were all young once.  ... excuse me?  Sera, if you eschew all things elven, why not use a crossbow? They require less training.  Ah, yes. Winchiness. A point I had not considered.  Ar dirthan'as ir elgara, ma'sula e'var vhenan.  Excuse me?  I'd hoped, well, our people can sometimes feel the rhythm of the language despite lacking the vocabulary.  Fenedhis lasa.  Have you ever had any interest in learning magic, Sera?  While it has not manifested naturally, there are ways to determine whether arcane gifts lie dormant within you.  Sleeping would give you the chance to explore the Fade. I could introduce you to spirits.  Why would I do that? It is not as though I know who filled my bedroll with lizards.  Our people used to be here.  It is more true than you want to believe.  Din elvhen emma him?  Sera? What are you feeling?  Not to everyone.  You are different. You are the furthest from what you were meant to be.  What color is the sky, Sera?  It is an earnest question. What color is the sky when you look at it?  And when you looked past the Breach? As perhaps you were drawn to do?  We are not so far apart, you and I.  Sera, I notice that in a recent fight, you killed someone I was already dealing with.  Just to be clear, you wish me to manipulate the delicate balance of the primordial energy of the Fade... faster.  I heard about your organization, Sera. I am impressed.  Hardly. But it is an opportunity. You have already divided your group's membership. That is wise. No one cell can betray all your secrets. The next step is to establish a rhythm. When your enemies pursue, you vanish. When they become complacent, you harass them. When they are weak, you strike in earnest.  Do you wish to be unnerved by another tale of my explorations of the Fade? Or do you wish to learn something?  Once you have the aristocracy weakened, Sera, you will have to redirect your lieutenants.  Some of your forces, valuable until now, have no interests beyond creating disruption. Chaos for its own sake. They must be repositioned where they can do no harm, or removed if necessary. You replace them with organizers willing to build a new system and carry out the ugly work that must be done.  That is up to you. Do you wish to disrupt the nobility, secure a title? Or change the political structure entirely?  I do not understand you, Sera. You have no end goal for your organization.  Why not go all the way? You see injustice, and you have organized a group to fight it. Don't you want to replace it with something better?  I...forgive me. You are right. You are fine as you are.  Yes, I have been known to do that.  Your interest is not my concern.  It is not a topic for discussion.  Think what you will. It is clear I am not here for you.  Don't concern yourself, vhenan. She is… apart from herself.  Only one of us is looking sad and foolish, Sera.  For you, it would be "ara seranna-ma." It is a coincidence that your name is within; the base form is common.  I am reasonably certain I said nothing.  You cannot upset me wth what we found there.  Because, Sera, my genuine sorrow for the tragedy of our history cannot be diminished by a single moment.  That you do not feel this, well, you have my envy... and pity.  Do I want to ask what for?  It is a shame, Sera, that you were denied an elven life. Even one as patchwork as the Dalish interpretation.  Were you not orphaned young and raised by humans?  It is said that we lived at a pace that sustained us for... ages.  I am decidedly uncomfortable.
