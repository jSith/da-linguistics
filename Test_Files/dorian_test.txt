 I am! Please feel free to write a book about me.  I'm not a magister! Oh forget it, you'll just get it wrong.  What's a deshyr from the Merchant's Guild doing in the middle of a battle against ancient evils?  You can't call me "pampered." Nobody peeled a grape for me in weeks.  So what's your estimation, Varric? Think we could win?  What would that look like? Three to one? (laughs.  After Corypheus pulled an archdemon out of his arse, are you joking?  Now now, if I weren't here, it would be five to one at least.  See? Here's a chance to test your confidence, Varric.  This is why I adore him so.  (grunts. I am a bad man. We'll talk later.  Varric, I want a new nickname.  You must know me better now. Or does the moniker you gave me five minutes after we met still apply?  So, I'm a bit of light you stick in a window sill to impress passersby? All flash, no heat? Hmm… that's actually pretty clever.  I'm very sorry about Hawke, Varric.  Does s/he have any family, or…?  Still good actually.  We're beating his minions, my hirsute little friend. Not the same thing. Besides, the moment we beat Corypheus into the sand, I'll be more than happy to pay up.  That will make it hard to spend my winnings, true.  (Sighs If my family had their way.  Livia Herandus  Oh yes. Trading coy insults at every party would have been a delight.  I'll take that bet. I win either way.  All right, never let it be said I don't pay my debts. Here you are  I had no idea nugs possess such creepy little feet. The stuff of nightmares.  You know, Varric, I went to Kirkwall once.  Bit of a shithole.  And if I don't? Do you have tiny enforcers come strip me of my holdings?  The dwarf plays dirty. All right, all right, you win. This time.  I would't worry, she's not my type.  For fine wine and literature, Varric. Not for… whatever that contraption is.  Varric, are you and Cassandra…?  Truly? Bizarre.  See? She's right there. What are you waiting for?  Not according to your books.  It's interesting, I'll give you that. An archdemon attacking me is a first.  I don't think I should take that bet.  To me? Are you referring to the giant hole in the sky? Or the creature out of Chantry cautionary tale who wants to be a god?  What's the problem? Someone shows up, tears the place apart, declares himself king? That's half of history.  Even after he puts a hole in the ceiling. Terribly common.  You owe me twenty royals, Varric. I'd like them paid in candied dates.  You said we'd be ass-deep in trouble. This is more like knee-high.  Leave it to a dwarf, always lowering the bar.  Varric, when you were at the Winter Palace, did you meet Celene's handmaidens?  They were asking me about you. Personal things.  Something about your chest hair, and whether you were currently... involved with anyone.  So these books you write, Varric... who actually reads them?  That's a lot of people? Do the southern masses even know how to read?  Yes? I left my homeland, Varric, I didn't up and turn peasant.  I'd assumed you'd go up to Weisshaupt with Hawke, Varric.  You should be thankful. I've been to Weisshaupt. It's not good. Carved into a mountain, cold, dour, everyone so bloody serious they can't take a piss... you wouldn't like it.  And he/she is quite the ray of sunshine, that's true.  Varric, did I hear this right? You met Corypheus before?  And he said, what? "Hello, I'm one of the magisters who broke into the Black City. Pleased to meet you!"  Not very well, it appears.  Where does that saying come from? I'm not a sheep. No one in my family could be described a "sheep".  Goodness, I had no idea.  Come on just answer the question, Varric  You must have an opinion. And you're a dwarf! Completely unbiased!  For the last time  Yes, but it's that black licorice candy with salt on it, not the good kind.  Care to play another game of cards when we get back to Skyhold, Varric?  Now, now, nobody ever died from those. Lately.  Varric, you've seen this "red lyrium" before, yes?  Do you know if a mage could access its power?  I don't see how this is even remotely your business, Varric.  Please stop helping the dwarf.  You could at least have had the courtesy to use the bedposts.  You do. You really do.  Vivienne, the poor thing is trying to pay you a compliment. How so, Cole?  Also, we clearly have the best fashion sense of anyone around.  Darkspawn? Madman? Relic of an unwanted past? Don't keep me in suspense.  *sarcastic voice* No!  I'm not here on behalf of my nation's reputation, Vivienne. I'm here to do what is right.  Official mage to the Orlesian Imperial Court? That sounds exciting.  Yes, being paraded about like an exotic peacock is better than running frantically from templars.  Oh! A dig at my homeland? This should be fun.  Vivienne, are you saying you wouldn't rather live in a land where mages aren't herded into cages like dogs?  I'm the first to admit magisters aren't perfect, but they've also done great things. They're allowed to.  Locking people into cages isn't the answer.  Truly? It's nice to know you have friends.  Rumors you were only too happy to verify, I assume.  ...Oh. Thank you.  I saw him once at a ball, but we never met. He had to leave early on account of assassination.  Kill him? No, no, he killed a magister. Could have waited until the dancing was finished.  How is it, Vivienne, that you weren't part of the rebellion with the rest of the southern mages?  Ah. Nothing like solidarity.  Your outfit's enteraining, I'll give you that.  I could have pretended. Wore fancy clothes, convinced everyone I'm something I'm not.  Then I could take a position at court, whore myself out, and desperately hope no one realizes what a fraud I am.  It's true. I've heard worse from our gardener back home.  It's true. I've heard worse from our gardener back home.  It's true. I've heard worse from our gardener back home.  (Sighs. What I wouldn't give for some proper wine.  Perhaps he found a bargain he couldn't pass up, on vats of vinegar?  Egad. We'd be forced to retaliate.  Vivienne, perhaps you can answer this-- why the bizarre Orlesian fixation with masks?  A strange custom in a culture where people assassinate each other for putting too much salt in the soup.  And you people call Tevinter barbaric.  With somewhat less cataclysmic results.  Only that I'm pleased we got out. Demons don't appreciate a man with good hair.  Wait... you're jealous, aren't you?  I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that someone walked into the Fade again.  So far as we know.  We don't know what happened to Corypheus and his lot. Even he doesn't seem to, not clearly.  I'm saying we should be careful what we assume when it comes to such matters.  Vivienne, we can continue this dance forever, if you wish.  I mock Orlesian frippery and nonsense, you mock Tevinter decadence and tyranny.  There is, however, something far more important we should remember.  At least we're not Antivan.  What would you say Blackwall's best feature is, Vivienne? Vivienne, I heard about your friend, the duke... I only meant to say I'm very sorry for your loss.  You must be greatly relieved, Vivienne, after what happened at the Winter Palace.  Your position is also secure, considering how instrumental the Inquisition was in Celene's survival.  (Chuckles. We're not in court, dear woman. No need for the honey.  Vivienne, I'm curious... you must have crossed paths with Lady Morrigan in the court, yes?  Odd, I'd have thought you'd easily relate to a commoner of ambition.  Sounds like someone's jealous their position at the empress's side was usurped.  It's fascinating listening to you two. Like working out a puzzle with only half the pieces.  Solas, I take it you study spirits?  Back in my homeland, we keep spirits as servants.  The things they can be made to be are quite marvelous, you should see them.  Ah, yes. Point taken.  Do you use spirits as servants, Solas? You'd have no trouble capturing them.  How much "will" do they have? They're amorphous constructs of the Fade.  There's no harm putting them to constructive use, and most mages back home treat them well.  What? Spirits don't have magical talent.  Solas, have I offended you?  Because we're here working together for a common cause, and because I respect your abilities.  Well, I... realize there's more to you than that.  I... was hoping we might find common ground, that's all.  Solas, that little flare you sometimes do with your staff... You're redirecting ambient energy to your personal aura?  Fascinating. It's a Tevinter technique. I've never seen anyone in this part of the world do it.  Oh! That means we... never mind, then.  While we're sharing surprises, you've done a lot less dancing naked in the moonlight than expected.  I wanted to see you make flowers bloom with your song, just once.  Solas, what's this whole look of yours about?  No, that outfit is sorry. What are you supposed to be, some kind of woodsman?  Is it a Dalish thing? Don't you dislike the Dalish? Or is it some kind of statement?  Well, it says "apostate hobo" to me.  Solas, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.  The elven city of Arlathan sounds like a magical place, and for my ancestors to have destroyed it...  I... don't know that I can do that.  The nullification disrupts any ambient magic lying about. Things then burn hotter.  Ah, no. I warp the Veil slightly to effect distance between the spells.  Like cracking a whip? Yes, tried it once. Made my teeth taste funny.  I can't believe you entered the Fade. Physically.  It's the second time that's been done in all of history. That's not nothing, Solas.  The Fade is still a mystery to us humans, yes. Probably always will be.  Let me get this straight, Solas.  You're an apostate - neither Dalish nor city elf - who lived alone in the woods studying spirits.  No, no. You're a special and unique snowflake. Live the dream.  You're not the first to say so.  Yes, and I'd live longer if I only ate rice and boiled vegetables, but that's just as unlikely.  Ah, Solas. You startled me. You're always so... nondescript.  That orb Corypheus carries... are you certain it's of elven origin, Solas?  There are paintings in the Magisterium's archives of men holding similar orbs.  They were depictions of a time long before the magisters. The ancient Dreamers, perhaps.  The texts called those orbs "somnaborium"--"vessels of dreams." Could they be the same thing?  And Corypheus isn't far removed from the time. Hmm.  We found elves, living ancient elves, at the Temple of Mythal. Does that bother you, Solas?  I mean them being there at all. Thousands of years later, and they live.  There could be others, in ruins we haven't yet discovered. Shouldn't we be looking for them?  Hmm. I wonder if that's a good thing?  The Imperium is founded on the notion that we defeated Arlathan.  It's not something my people should be proud of, but they are. It's ingrained in their psyche.  I'm worried what it might do to them if they did.  That seems unnecessary.  Who hasn't already seen your collection of books  The way you talk about magic--you’ve never been on good terms with a mage?  Better? Do you know what your southern Circles are like?  (Sighs. You're sadly right.  Where do you get all your arrows, Sera? You have hundreds  My arse should open up a shop. It's apparently quite prolific.  Indulge me, Sera. What do you think of when I say "demon?"  Fine. "Magister?"  Not helpful, but given our history, I'll accept it. "Thaumaturgy?"  Magical endeavors. Helpful wonders.  (Sighs.  How is a Tevinter supposed to laugh, exactly?  Oh no. You're not allowed to laugh like that until you get your magister license.  Meaning what, exactly?  I'm going to take that as a compliment. Sadly, there's an element there who would welcome Corypheus with open arms. A stupidly short-sighted element.  Ha! Quite.  Me? Are you referring to...?  I left all that behind. Although I do miss the gold-shitting from time to time.  I have only one question, Sera  You could try using something other than a rusty butter knife.  Scissors. The word you're looking for is "scissors."  What, you mean like "mendicant?" "Ultimatum?"  Vishante kaffas. It's, Tevene, relics of the old tongue. We still use the colorful phrases.  Literally? "You shit on my tongue."  A mystery for the ages.  I can't believe you're scared of magic, Sera. It's a gift as mundane to me as your bow to you. Surely you see there's nothing to fear in a properly used tool.  There's an image.  That's not-- I don't think I can continue.  I'm wondering if familiarity would cure your suspicion of magic.  Please stop saying "tool," and consider how much magic can accomplish. There are benefits for you and everyone; as the Maker said, "magic exists to serve."  As long as you're careful where you shoot all those arrows.  Now we can live together in peace and harmony.  (Laughs How do you picture me "busting out"? I'm walking around and oops, demon? I mean it could happen, despite my training. You could also trip and impale your eye on an arrow.  Certainly. But only because you are so dear to me.  Not quite. Corypheus is one-of-a-kind. An original darkspawn, it turns out.  Oh, that. Not all of them, but enough.  There's always more where they come from. Men like Corypheus aren't born, they're made.  For being so unnerved by magic, you aren't shy about benefiting from its effects.  You consider swathing yourself in flame or ice normal and “not magic”?  That was only... you know, if it lets you sleep at night, never mind.  Sera, what are you wearing? Are you sure it's dead?  Fewer horses, marginally. More cheering, definitely.   I can't believe you made it through the Winter Palace in one piece.  You don't play their stupid game, they send an assassin or three your way.  You have no problem with escalation, do you?  (Chuckles  You must have been driven mad in the temple, hm?  It was mystifying. Lovely turn of phrase incidentally.  Sad.. I would’ve given half a toe to have seen it.  (chuckles If I were any nicer to him, we’d be joined to the hip.  Yes... Well, that seems unlikely.  Something particularly funny?  I'm glad it amuses you, but what I get from my affairs is... my affair.  I'm not sure which is worse, the mockery or the accuracy.  I see you're having fun with your illustrious paramour.  (if Inquisitor is a mage No! Ugh, no! I meant you appear to be enjoying your new relationship.  You couldn't ask for a more personal introduction to magic.  It's that simple?  (if Inquisitor is not a mage I meant you appear to be enjoying your new relationship.  I did, in words you apparently don't understand.  Let me do us both a favor and retract the question.  Thieves! Dog stink!  Treacherous teyrns!  Teyrn is a Fereldan title, beneath only the family of the king. I'd have expected you of all people to know that.  Too late! I believe that's my round.  I can't figure you out, Sera.  You just picked up a bow one day, and poof! Expert marksman! A veritable savant!  A savant. A natural. Meaning you needed no training.  I'll... keep that in mind.  You know, I've never met an elf quite like you Sera.  Not all of them, but yes... you have a point.  No, but I'm glad I have now.  For hating the outdoors, you sure seem to like bad weather.  The other day, you were outside in the rain, staring up with a grin on your face.  Of course you do.  Are we still talking about clouds?  Never mind. Drinks and insults later?  About anything in particular?  Most of the Imperial Chantry’s teachings are the same as in the south…despite some finicky bits about magic.  Yes. Quite. The parts where we’re “wrong.”  Well, pardon us.  (if in the party Now there's a turn of phrase.  By all means let us discuss this together.  I'm happy, he's happy, everyone's happy.  (Sighs.  Not that my warning did much good.  There is that. The ones who didn't join the Venatori either ran off or were killed.  I'm thrilled, really.  We have a Ben-Hassrath with us? A spy. An actual Qunari spy.  That doesn't strike anyone as a bad thing?  That's... not a terrible point. Okay.  You've killed lots of my countrymen, I take it?  What? Never just for fun?  I hope it doesn't bother you to travel alongside a "Vint," Iron Bull.  I'm also a mage. Would you prefer me bound and leashed?  Hopefully before you sewed my mouth shut.  Nothing at all, Bull? No problem having a "Vint" behind you?  You can't deny you enjoy butchering my people.  Well, that much is true.  I'm not thrilled to discover we should take those old legends at face value.  Why wouldn't he? Tevinter once covered all Thedas, its glory only matched by its depravity.  It'd be like Koslun showing up and learning the Qunari didn't conquer the world after all.  It's significantly more impressive than hitting them with a sharp piece of metal.  Of course. I'm not a plebian.  With the dancers, yes. You're making me homesick.  (Groans.  I'm not wearing a skirt.  No Qunari would accept a Tevinter mage so easily... unless it was a ruse. When should I expect a knife in the back?  That's different.  Fine, not all of you.  Err... not today.  Watch where you're pointing that thing!  Vishante kaffas! I meant your weapon!  I have only the one?  You're not suggesting we're similar.  I may vomit.  What does the Qunari priesthood tell your people about losing the war?  They've been fighting Tevinter for centuries and still haven't won.  It's barely an eye-watering slap fight, I'll grant you, but every now and again it heats up.  What are they waiting for?  So they're the Chargers and you're the Bull. That's clever.  That I'd like to see.  You seemed remarkably comfortable at the Winter Palace, Bull.  You didn't knock over a single priceless statue, or fart even once near the dessert table.  I'm surprised you never spent time in the Tevinter courts. They would adore you.  Abelas said the elves destroyed themselves. I'm still wrapping my head around that.  For one, I've no proof. Secondly, if I did, they'd lose their collective minds.  They might decide they have something to prove. Can you imagine?  Vishante kaffas! Don't you ever bathe?  I'd rather stand upwind.  I will never understand why Qunari warriors spend half their time running around bare-chested.  It's stupid. They should wear armor.  They should wear armor all the time!  (Growls.  What would you know about it? True Qunari don't have families.  Yay. Good on me.  Why is it always so cold? How do you southerners stand it?  My footsies are freezing, thank you.  You stand there, flexing your muscles, huffing like some beast of burden with no thought save conquest.  Uh. What?  No. It was very much not.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  You are impossible. This is... (Growls.  (Sighs. Discretion isn't your thing, is it?  If you choose to leave your door unlocked like a savage, I may or may not come.  A Grey Warden Recruiter. That sounds interesting.  Here I thought you poked around prisons, hunting for murderers desperate to escape the noose.  It's not such a terrible thing. Some of my best friends are murderers.  Who's judging now?  What do you know of "my kind", Blackwall?  It might sound that way to someone who's been clubbed on the head too often.  That's what I'd expect from your kind.  (Sighs. I can't imagine why more people don't join the Wardens!  If I had something to say, I'd say it.  And I'd expect no less from a brutish thug.  Tell that to mister barely concealed envy issues!  Best pound your chest so nobody doubts.  With proper hygiene and grooming. Maybe all three of you should get acquainted.  Stranger things have happened. It would take work. And soap. Lots and lots of soap.  I've often wondered what the average man thinks about mage freedom.  True. So much for that.  You caught the eye of a young woman in that last village, Blackwall.  You're right. She was undoubtedly looking at me.  Any thoughts on this "Herald of Andraste" business, Blackwall?  I just need to know you're capable of higher thought. For my own comfort.  You'd do a word puzzle if I gave it to you?  One of mine? Like a pet? Like a giant darkspawn hamster with aspirations of godhood?  'Dorian, why can't you look after your little friends? Corypheus peed on the carpet again!'  In this analogy, the carpet is Haven.  Meaning 'the source of everything bad and evil in the world'? They are the same, yes?  When did I do that?  Hmm. That does sound like me.  You're surprised they haven't all dismissed me as "the charming, but ultimately wicked magister"?  A prince? I've moved up in the world. My reasons for being here are the same as yours, thank you.  Perhaps when you get past the simple heuristics that define your world, we'll get along.  I am very good at the whole magic thing.  Why be ashamed? Power should be respected, not swept under the carpet.  Maybe you’re not a complete moron.  Only verifying certain rumors, Big Man. You understand.  Academic? Future generations will want to know.  I overheard you at the tavern, Blackwall, asking about the Inquisitor and I.  You have a question? Are your whiskers quivering with curiosity?  Are you certain? I can draw diagrams.  I can't believe they served that swill at the tavern. What is Skyhold coming to?  I couldn't stop. With each sip, it was, "it can't be that bad, can it?" Before I knew it, I was analyzing the nuances of its flavor, observing its effect on my nausea. I was in a catatonic trance, fueled by the stench of disgusting dwarven ale.  There is that.  Oh? Why not?  Ignoring that that's not the case, I suspect people will use any excuse to hate us.  Did everyone act like this when the sword was invented? "Oh, my blushing butt cheeks! Round up everyone who can use these pointy things and lock them away!"  You must be joking.  Visit Tevinter one day. Minrathous will put your southern cities in perspective.  I've been thinking.  I was about to say you're too hard yourself, Blackwall.  You're not the thug I thought you were. You're not the thug anyone thought you were.  Point is  Of course not. Let's not go crazy with defying expectations.  So, I hit a nerve with the whole "murderer Grey Warden" business.  Yes, you. "Blackwall," or whatever your name is.  I'm saying I understand wanting to atone for one's actions.  Enough to know when I've stepped in it. So I apologize.  People who say that to me are usually wrong.  Obviously the original Blackwall saw something in you. I respect that.  I didn't like that life.  Truce?  I must admit, Cassandra, I've never heard of these "Seekers of Truth."  But what are they? Some manner of super-Templar? Is this one of those Southern secrets, like proper hygiene?  Ah. That clearly worked out well.  Incidentally, Cassandra, I'm well aware you lied to me.  When you said the Mage Rebellion was beyond the power of the Seekers to control? I've since heard your Order could have prevented it, but instead led the Templars into war once it started.  Knee-jerk defense of your former comrades? I quite understand.  Oh? Were they not responsible for keeping peace with the mages?  Cassandra, I owe you an apology.  For judging your seekers. Considering my feelings about Tevinter, I shouldn't throw stones.  It was fun to goad you. You get this little knot between your eyebrows... See, there it is! Delightful.  Still don't like me, Cassandra? After all this time?  Not every way. There is my family.  Ghastly, isn't it? Toss it all on the fire and be done with it, that's what I say.  I knew you'd come around.  Let me guess  Darling Cassandra, Corypheus is from a Tevinter that's been dead and gone a thousand years. Whatever nostalgic vision he's selling, it has little to do with my Tevinter. Or his followers', frankly.  Some of my current countrymen look at the current state of our nation and despair. They hear how powerful and glorious we once were and think, "That would be better. It has to be." What they overlook is that Corypheus wasn't here for our downfall. He has no idea that it was unavoidable.  You're asking me? I'll wager he believes he is the truth.  Is it true that the Rite of Tranquility can be reversed, Cassandra?  Maker's breath. If I count the Tranquil in Tevinter alone...  It's a sentence handed down by the Magisterium. "Abuse of magic" has so many convenient interpretations.  Cassandra, my mother has a friend who's a Pentaghast. Perhaps you know of him.  Enormously fat man. Three chins, four mansions, five ways to sell you out, as Mother liked to say.  (Sighs Let's hope so.  I won't say you're lucky, because that's not true, but there are days...  Why, Cassandra, I've never seen you smile so much!  Now you're not, but only because I pointed it out.  That would be easier to believe if you hadn't just blushed.  I always smile. People like my smile, and they should! I have excellent teeth.  It depends how long until dinner.  I must be, or you wouldn't have been thinking about it all this time.  Look at this profile. Isn't it incredible? I picture it in marble.  Proof it isn't an Archdemon at all, I'd say.  If Grey Wardens are good for anything, it's killing an Archdemon. This one rose again.  I'd say Corypheus created it. A tribute to his Old Gods, or an emulation of them.  That, or we need a much deeper chasm.  My family once took me to Nevarra, Cassandra.  I was young, and all I wanted to do was visit a necropolis. I was desperate.  Ah. There goes that childhood fantasy.  So tell me this  And then what? Let them... wander around willy-nilly?  Forever? I almost feel bad for them.  A little bird tells me you might be up for the Sunburst throne Cassandra.  You certainly would be a first step towards that.  You'd be mad to consider it. Can you imagine the target it would place on you?  Do you think they'll actually make you Divine?  It's so odd. Like waiting for the Chantry fairy to appear."Congratulations! You're the ruler!"  The successor must prove he could slaughter his enemies, he doesn't actually do it. We're not savages.  (Chuckles That's considered housekeeping.  I'm imagining what you would look like... in a dress.  How do you want to be remembered, Cassandra? Valiant yet sexy rebel against the status quo?  Sword raised high, blue scarf dramatically fluttering in the wind, sun rising behind you?  It's a painting, of course. Work with me. It'll be fantastic.  If you were still a Seeker, would you drag me to one of your Circles?  But you'd do it even though I'm incredibly charming?  All true.  Doesn't matter. All true. Particularly the part with the grapes and feathers.  Tell me, Cassandra  I must admit I never tried that.  You're not possessing a human body, Cole? You... actually look like that?  But a spirit's true form is always monstrous, or at least unnatural.  And... this is how you want to look?  Can you change your form, Cole? If you wanted to look like something else?  Hmm. There are magisters who'd be ecstatic if they could summon a demon who could pass for human.  You're right about that. They would.  Do you need to eat, Cole? Or sleep?  That's something. I don't know what, but it's something.  What about when you're injured? Why do you bleed? Is it because you think you have to?  I... Well, yes. You have me there.  I'm curious about you. I had no idea something like you was possible.  You can ask me questions, if you like. I'm not sure why you'd want to, but...  I'm... going to regret this, aren't I?  It's true. I did say that.  I'm not certain I can explain it to you.  Sometimes... sometimes love isn't enough, Cole.  (Sighs. I was rather hoping I had.  Cole, this... is not the sort of discussion for walking around. Please drop it.  I know I did. The things you ask are just... very personal.  Can someone tell him to stop? Banish him back to the Fade or something?  (sigh Marvelous! Everyone's so helpful!  No, I'm sorry. Of course you don't understand. Just... leave me with it for now.  I've been trying to imagine how to explain it to you, Cole.  The thing is, sometimes the ones you love are also the ones who disappoint you the most.  You think that if they love you, they should understand. They shouldn't want to hurt you.  So you feel betrayed. You say things you can't ever take back.  Yes, like that.  Did you enjoy the Winter Palace, Cole?  Did you try dancing, or did you skulk around invisibly?  And not poke around in the heads of the other dancers.  Is that what that light, tingly feeling is? I suppose you're right.  But he did.  You know why. I had to stop the Venatori.  Digging around in my head again, are you?  (sigh Rather like inviting someone into your house and they walk off with the silverware!  Cole, you should be careful dancing around with those daggers when I'm throwing fire.  That doesn't always mean what you think it means.  The stuff of dreams? An explosion of color and sensation wrapped in an enigma?  So when I cast a fireball, it's just the Fade saying "peek-a-boo"?  If it says anything other than "I'm going to burn your face off," I don't want to hear it.  Cole, are those real clothes, or...?  I thought maybe you conjured them. Like your physical form.  Never mind. Forget I said anything.  That little trick, Cole, when you dip into someone's mind and take a drink?  Do you choose what you're looking for, or is it random?  I'll... thank you not to do that again, please.  Are you what?  You're all right. Might want to rethink the hats.  Festus bei umo canavarum.  That's true. Just...go ask the Inquisitor this one.  I drew you a diagram. Isn't that enough?  Good. Because the thought of you trying that frightens me more than a little.  Cole, the wooden duck I found on my bed... was that you?  I mean did you put it there?  Cole, do you hear magic?  Spells sometimes make a sound, but... I don't think we hear the same thing.  Not lately.  Cole, you saw Corypheus when he attacked Haven. What was your... read on him?  Did he actually walk into the Black City? Is that true?  I'll... take that as a "maybe."  Any progress on protecting yourself from binding, Cole?  Hop to it! You're quick with those daggers. I'd rather not have them pointed at me.
