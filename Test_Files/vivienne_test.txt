  Also, the answer is obvious.  Of course you do, darling.  I was born in Wycome, if you must know.  Wycome is a civilized city-state. Unlike some.  Am I to understand, Varric, that you knew the apostate who destroyed Kirkwall's chantry?  What could he possibly have hoped to accomplish with such madness?  I take it he's no longer on your Winter's end gift list.  Only if you tie it with a silk ribbon, my dear.  You know, Varric darling, I read your Hard in Hightown.  Most of the Imperial Court did. It was in fashion a few winters ago.  How very observant.  Grand Duke Gaspard laid siege to the city while I was attending to business for the Circle.  The Circle shattered, the empire is at war, and the Divine is dead. Only an imbecile would consider this "lucky."  I do. But it doesn't necessarily follow that I would share them.  Not to you, darling. Where's the benefit there?  Do say whatever you're thinking, darling. If you hold it in any longer your face will split apart.  It's your face.  It was bestowed by a Marquise, sadly no longer with us.  Am I to understand that you... are writing a book about me?  What kind of book is it?  And what role do I play in this thriller of yours?  (laughs  Don't be ridiculous, darling. Why would you be in trouble?  Not at all! I find it delightful.  My dear, if I didn't want for people to fear me, I wouldn't dress like this. The book is perfect.  Varric, darling, what manner of villain am I in your novel?  Yes, but what am I wearing? You are not going to describe me in anything less than the latest fashions, are you?  Yes, my dear. And my mask should be inlaid with opals.  How many chapters will this book be, Varric dear?  The first one?  And what happens to the scheming duchess in the first book?  Hints, darling. Not spoiler.  You never answered my question, Varric darling.  I am providing you with details of Orlesian court life. Shouldn't you owe me something in return?  Oh, really?  Hmm. That will do.  Tell me, Varric, who is the protagonist of this serial?  Come now, darling. You can tell me.  Aren't you rather wealthy to be dirtying your hands like this, Varric?  I just don't see any profit that would motivate a member of the Merchant's Guild to fight.  I can hardly wait.  It's impossible to say, my dear. Anyone who has ever so mis-stepped was stabbed to death with the proper fork.  I cannot understand, Varric, how someone born into wealth and power would choose to live like a peasant.  You ignore your peers and spend your time amongst laborers and criminals in taverns.  You know perfectly well what I mean, darling.  You have very peculiar tastes.  Varric darling, what's the name of your tailor?  I want to send a sternly worded letter.  I suppose you support the Chantry as a business decision, Varric?  Really? You can't possibly be one of the faithful.  Whatever are you talking about, darling?  Oh, aren't you precious?  No, dear. You couldn't possibly offend me.  Darling, your civility has so little to do with your faults, I wouldn't let that trouble you.  Just keep hitting things, my dear. Don't worry your little head about the rest.  I'm sure I don't know, darling. Do you imagine I spend all my waking hours worrying about your self-improvement?  My dear Blackwall, there's nothing you can do to make your Order relevant to our present situation.  You really must stop assuming everything is about you. It's unbecoming.  There is nothing curious about it.  So much is at stake. Why would I leave any of it to someone else?  I miss them. I do not require them.  But please, continue to imagine me a pampered lady, if it makes you feel superior.  (Laughs. It’s just mud. Mud bothers me as much as your clumsy mockery, which is to say, not at all.  Will you put your shield down? The light glinting off it pierces my eyes.  They are fine quality crystals.  I wish we had more proper Chevaliers in the Inquisition and fewer...lowlife thugs.  You recognized yourself there? Good.  You presume to know my feelings?  I merely believe the world's problems are more complex than you imagine.  I could travel the whole world, righting wrongs as you do, and still accomplish nothing in the end.  You are naive. And arrogant, if you think passing through a life has the power to change it.  It's not as simple as you think, my dear.  You're right in one thing. You wouldn't stand a chance against me.  I must remember to send a thank-you gift to the Marquise Tremaine. Something delicious, perhaps?  Of course not, my dear.  What was that wonderful restorative Bastien had... the one with violets.  Yes! Wait, how do you--  Yes, I imagine you do.  We do have facilities available to the Inquisition, you understand?  Bathing shows common courtesy to one's traveling companions.  Well, you two seem to make each other happy.  I was just wondering how you imagined your future. The Inquisitor and the-- well, whatever you are now.  Thank you.  You are very kind, but you needn't concern yourself.  Really? How many people do they conscript in the name of "vigilance against the Blight"? Hundreds? Thousands? For a threat that recent history tells us can be successfully ended by just two. Yes, they certainly are heroes, and not at all a wasteful relic of a bygone age. Whatever could I find objectionable?  You can't seriously ask me that after what happened at Adamant.  Where shall I start, my dear? The blood magic? Human sacrifice? Demon summoning? Or the part where they serve Corypheus?  Yes, they certainly are heroes, and not at all a wasteful relic of a bygone age. Whatever could I find objectionable?  How ironic that I thought you were irrelevant as a Grey Warden, and you weren't even that.  From Warden to jester! What a tremendous journey.  I'm curious, Cassandra. Why were you not at the Conclave?  A rather fortunate delay, it turns out.  You must not blame yourself, dear. You have done all you could and more.  Neither are you, clearly.  That which makes you different can be a burden or a source of strength, my dear. Which is up to you.  They were merchants, originally from Dairsmuid... or so I'm told.  I was taken to the Ostwick Circle when I was very young. So far as I'm concerned, my life began there.  My dear Cassandra, I am impressed with how well-organized the Inquisition was in the aftermath of the Conclave.  Perspective, darling. The Chantry hasn't even found the right vestment for issuing a statement on the Divine's death.  Take your victories where you can, dear.  Were you well acquintanced with Divine Justinia, Cassandra?  I envy even your slight acquintance. By reputation she was a formidable woman.  Oh, they will, darling. Even if they have to trim off her toes and heels to fit.  I wonder, Cassandra, that you did not put yourself forward to lead the Inqusition while Divine Justinia was forming it.  How do you fall short of that description, my dear? Did you not single handedly saved the capital of Orlais?  Yet still heroic. Many in the empire remember you fondly.  You are too modest, Cassandra dear. To many you're a figure of awe! You should make use of that.  But don't seem to enjoy it? You really ought to have more fun, darling.  I assure you there are few pleasures comparable to restoring order with one's own hand.  You've done a fine job thus far, Seeker, but you could stand to be... slightly more amiable.  Of course, darling. One must never be too charming or people lose respect. Too intimidating, however, and you'll never be invited to anything. Then you may as well be dead in a ditch.  The game is played to the death, my dear. Like it or not, you are part of it.  Not now, perhaps, but you could.  It is a battle, my dear. The armor and the weapon differ, but just as much blood is spilled.  You are a warrior, Cassandra. You be one whether you dress in steel or lace.  About my suggestion that you play the Game?  I suggest a vibrant red, darling. Not too deep in the neckline, mind you.  I suggest a vibrant red, darling. Not too deep in the neckline, mind you.  He's a man, darling. All men appreciate a touch of skilled artifice.  You're not a battering ram, darling.  It's disappointing. But perhaps some battles should be left to those more suited.  There's no need to tiptoe, darling.  We were, yes--and I will cherish the years we had.  More questions! My, aren't we curious today? Seeking guidance in the matters of the heart?  It will be fine, dear.  So Leliana is a candidate for Divine. It's hardly surprising. She plays a pretty Game.  Important qualities for whomever takes the Sunburst throne.  The Divine stands apart. She must command respect and attention or she will accomplish nothing.  Which means we have two fine candidates. Wouldn't you agree?  Such modesty!  You made quite the impression at the Winter Palace.  Not the most distinguished impression, certainly, but given your discomfort, I expected worse.  Come, my dear, there's no need to be touchy. You will do far better next time.  Did you think you could dance with one of the most powerful man in southern Thedas and go unnoticed?  It was on the lips of half the court before the song was done. It... could have take a day or two for news to reach the capital given the disruptions of the civil war.  You weren't aiming for discretion, were you?  I do hope you intend to rebuild your Seekers, Cassandra.  With the templars all but lost as well?  The threat posed by dangerous magic still exists, my dear. Someone will have to deal with it.  I'm pleased to hear it, my dear. With the Templars all but lost, we need someone to deal with dangerous magic.  I'm pleased to hear it, my dear. The Templars must deal with dangerous magic eventually - and they'll need your help.  (Sigh. At least the Inquisition has the sense to ally with the templars. When this is all over there will be someone capable with dealing with magical threats.  You know, Cassandra, you really ought to have armor with gilding. Or dragon scales. Preferably both.  It would be dramatic, my dear. Half the value of armor is intimidation.  My dear Cassandra, whatever persuaded you to bring Varric to the Conclave?  He wrote all of that down, did he not? He didn't need to come in person.  So you are seventy-eighth in line to the Nevarran throne, Cassandra? That is rather far off. Even so, many enjoy the idle life afforded by the most distant of titles. You could have been provided with every luxury. If you'd remained in that life.  You pursued duty and responsibility, a path that took you next to the Sunburst Throne. Well played.  You must admit it does help.  One does not survive the Orlesian court without learning to adapt, my dear.  You needn't tell me that. We all have our little sacrifices.  I've heard your uncle is a Mortalitasi, Cassandra.  You must understand, the rumours in the South surrounding Mortalitasi...  Of course, my dear. They need better oversight, clearly, but one does not throw away a tool because it was misused.  Speak to Ferelden's first enchanter. You might be surprised. When abominations ravaged your tower, suddenly the world holds far too few templars.  You must see the value in restoring the circles, Cassandra.  Or recreating its opposite. An overly lenient circle is a comparable threat. Kirkwall is lamentable, but it was the blithe misuse of power, not restrictions, that led to the first Blight.  Cassandra, you do know they still tell tales of the dragon attack at Val Royeaux?  Many yet live who saw it with their own eyes.  You are too modest, dear. You could have parlayed that victory into more than a position at the Divine's right hand.  Your apostate friend did not benefit from formal training in a Circle.  The Circle taught me the tricks demons play to gain the trust of any mage foolish enough to listen.  Solas seems to trust you. How long before you turn on him?  But you'd like to be more, wouldn't you? You could be together forever if you possessed him.  Is that not truly what you want? A body to claim your own, so you never have to return to the Fade?  My dear Inquisitor, please restrain your pet demon. I do not want it addressing me.  It's a demon, darling. All it can do is harm.  Delightful.  My dear, your pet is speaking again. Do silence it.  Inquisitor, as your demon lacks manners, perhaps you could get Solas to train it.  Remember, Inquisitor, the harmless-looking ones are always the most dangerous.  I was not referring to nugs.  It's probably thankful it doesn't have ears, and can't listen to you.  Now. I need. A bath.  Are you still talking?  I think not.  The same could be said of any mage. Beyond that, I have little in common with a noble from Tevinter.  True, but I hardly expect the Fade to notice.  Nonsense, as usual.  What were you doing at the Spire demon?  You helped mages escape?  Of course. I should have guessed that a demon's help would end in blood.  Cole... you were the Ghost of the Spire.  Your murders stirred the Circle into a frenzy. That was what brought the attention of the templars.  Stupid, panicking mages who became a danger to themselves and others because of you!  You brought matters in the Spire to a head. Without you, there would be no rebellion.  Countless deaths are on your head, demon. Are you satisfied with the result of your protection?  It can learn after all.  Get. Out.  They "helped" her. Just like you did. Anyone who wouldn't fight for freedom was "freed" by fire and lightning. Stay out of my thoughts demon. My memories are my own.  You are no longer a danger of being bound by enemies of the Inquisition, demon?  No more than you were before.  I was concerned about you, demon.  You have grown adept at killing. If you cannot be gone, I would prefer you remain pointed at the enemy.  Why are you still here? If you truly worried about being bound by blood magic, you would leave.  Then perhaps you should go further.  Of course not. Such magic is a tool for the weak. That the Warden mages resorted to it is pitiful.  As I said... pitiful.  Were you sad, watching your fellow spirits banished at Adamant, Cole?  "Last time"? Are we to understand you have been to Adamant before?  So your visit to Adamant was "better" this time, despite the arrival of an Archdemon?  Your point, demon?  One does not wish to brag.  People can only kill you.  Out, please.  I shall try to suppress my shock.  Did you expect me to get misty-eyed over who rose to glory and who paid the price demon? It is the Game. No matter what transpired in the Winter Palace, I took steps to strengthen my position.  Practice.  I beg your pardon, demon?  Remove yourself from my head.  She took nothing. If Empress Celene wished the counsel of some untrained witch, she was free to seek it.  She feared the consequences of angering me.  Apparently, it dons a hat and prattles endlessly.  I get that at court too darling. They get used to disappointment. Courtiers always do.  With so many rifts marking the world, I am surprised any demons nearby do not fall back through.  It would be a simple matter for such misguided creatures to return to their home and leave this confusing world behind.  Would that not be easier for everyone involved, my dear?  (Sighs.  I presume you know what they will say of Corypheus, Dorian.  They will say he is Tevinter.  I'm aware you claim to be here to counter that, but the damage is done.  If only more of your countrymen felt as you do.  It is an esteemed position, darling, that many mages would envy.  Better an exotic peacock than one Tevinter rat amongst many.  Which land is that? The one where mages are feared and despised as tyrants?  Monstrous things as well, or you wouldn't be here, would you?  Naturally. First we execute those who will not submit, then we deal with the rest.  I received a letter the other day, Dorian.  It was from an acquaintance in Tevinter expressing his shock at the disturbing rumors about your... relationship with the Inquisitor.  I informed him the only disturbing thing in evidence was his penmanship.  I am not so quick to judge, darling. See that you give me no reason to feel otherwise.  I'm curious, Dorian  Someone tried to kill him?  Those of us outside of the Circles could not be compelled to revolt.  This from a man who hails from a nation where mages kill each other for sport.  (Chuckles. It's rather amusing, Dorian.  The way you sneer at "southerners," pretending to be a shark from a land of sharks.  But you're not a shark and never will be, darling. They knew it, just as you do.  Such snapping for a fish without teeth.  My dear Inquisitor, whatever is the issue? We are having a perfectly civil conversation.  My dear Inquisitor, whatever is the issue? We are having a perfectly civil conversation.  My dear Inquisitor, whatever is the issue? We are having a perfectly civil conversation.  Skyhold's steward is a sadistic little man who is trying to kill us.  (Chuckles. It could be worse, darling. It could be an Anders vintage.  It's part of the Game, my dear. You never see your opponent's true visage.  An additional challenge to be navigated. Fail at the Game and you die.  You are barbarians, darling, but that's part of your charm.  You've walked into the Fade, Dorian, as did your Tevinter forebears.  No observations beyond that?  Don't be absurd.  We should count ourselves fortunate no cataclysm was unleashed.  What are you suggesting, my dear? An invisible cataclysm, lurking amongst us?  Hmm. Wise words, uncharacteristic as that might be.  Presuming both of us are capable.  Just what might that be?  Quite right. Thank the Maker.  Vivienne Bastien was not my "friend," darling, and I'll forego your bland and ill-informed observations.  The entire empire breathes a sigh of relief, darling.  I was pleased to have even a small part in the endeavor.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There is no need to use that title, my dear. She is an ill-bred apostate, nothing more.  You thought incorrectly. It's outrageous that she has been forced on the Inquisition.  As did Celene, yet the only one I've seen benefit is Morrigan herself.  More likely she will help herself.  Darling, if I was upset by every sycophant who claimed a portion of Celene's attention, I'd have no time to eat or sleep.  You will address me as Enchanter Vivienne, Court Mage to the Empire of Orlais, or Madame de Fer. Not, "Viv."  Hmm. Yes, "ma'am" works as well.  Iron Bull, did you clean your weapon after the last fight?  Thank you, darling.  I wonder what sort of eyepatch we should get you.  I think gold, inlaid with glowing lyrium and amethysts...  You cannot go shirtless in front of the preeminent nobles of Orlais. Let us see...  In Halamshiral, you were a blade of cheap iron. When I am done, you will shine like a gleaming dawnstone saber.  A purple coat, tight at the waist, slashed with silver, emerald accents. Open at the collar to accentuate your chest.  Every woman will want you. Every man will want to be you.  Now, Bull, the steps of the Dance of Six Candles?  Bull... step, step, turn...?  My dear, I don't believe there is such a thing as "a little bit tamassran."  Bull, darling, I wear high heels and tall hats. Fashion is not, so far as I know, a demand of the Qun.  Of course. Magic works best when responsibly supervised, for the safety and protection of all.  Hardly. Magic is dangerous, and with the Inquisition's alliance, the mages are now dangerously independent.  Hardly. At least they have been made keenly aware of the restrictions of their role within the Inquisition.  Life is a series of necessary restrictions, Iron Bull.  The small-minded beat against every wall they find. The wise learn to make the most of the options they have.  I have heard of the life of the saarebas, Iron Bull, but I am curious about your viewpoint.  You sound as though you pity them.  Not you, though.  Why do you ask?  It needs gold caps on the towers, bunting in the courtyard, and a great deal of soap.  At the bare minimum. Ideally we could have the battlements enameled or... sheathed in marble.  This is the limitation of your upbringing under the Qun, darling. Skyhold must not merely unnerve potential foes. It must entice potential allies.  Of course! Florianne's motive was unfortunate, but hardly inscrutable.  Then it is fortunate that we did stop him.  Orlais is selfish. But that ambition you decry breeds its own strengths. Those who rule Orlais never fear treachery from the rest of the world. They have already faced far worse.  No. The Grey Wardens are free of the confines of the Circle, so they may battle the darkspawn unfettered.  Some mages who chafe at the Circle's constraints actually hope to be recruited.  Darling, my interests lie in the Circle and the Court. The Wardens are irrelevant to both.  Not physically, as you were at Adamant.  I can imagine.  A most unpleasant experience.  The water was utterly dreadful, and the lighting was dreary.  No. My Harrowing was nothing like that.  Why not?  Actually the depth of emotion you experience might draw demons to you more strongly.  I understand that under the Qun, mages are tightly controlled to protect others from their power.  I never worry, darling. A leash can be pulled from either end.  Mages in Orlais do not fight without permission, my dear. Some are better at gaining permission than others.  The proper tool for the proper task. Fire reminds an enemy that you can destroy everything around. Lightning puts the fear of the Maker into her. Cold makes her think you implacable, while spirit energy conjures fears of demons.  That's fine too, dear.  As part of our Harrowing, we must prove we can defend against possession, and thus are no danger to the world.  Don't worry, my dear. Should we encounter demons, I will protect you.  Excuse me?  I shall.  Iron Bull, stop picking at that scab or it won't heal properly.  Thank you, darling.  My dear Iron Bull, stand up straight. You're slouching like a sulking child.  Darling, you are in no danger from a door beam. Just watch where you're going.  I confess, Iron Bull, I had assumed you would not be comfortable fighting alongside a mage.  That is hardly the same.  So, I am a qunari dreadnought?  Not at all. I am Madame de Fer.  Tell me, Iron Bull, is there anything I can do to assist you more effectively in combat?  You do so much fighting at the front. I would help however I may. If my skills can weaken your opponents to make your fight easier, please let me know.  I am always happy to help.  It is somewhat uncommon, yes.  The next time we make camp, I intend to construct a bath. I will need you to find me fresh water.  Very little. No mage of the Circle had encountered anything like this before the Breach.  It is properly Madame Vivienne, official mage to the Imperial Court.  How ever shall I recover from your condemnation?  For you, my dear? No.  Could you be more of an embarrassment in what the Inquisitor and I are trying to accomplish?  I have something for your silly group, Sera dear.  A simple note for your Red Jenny associates. I believe it may point to anonymous holdings of one Lord Samerath.  Indeed. It would be a shame if his involvement in certain activities was revealed, his position at court weakened.  Try not to cry openly, dear, it is ever so demeaning.  What is that horrendous smell?  Where... where is it coming from?  (Sighs  Darling, it's your bottom. Again. As bony and sad as it was the last dozen times you've displayed it.  Maker, however shall I endure this horror. Someone fetch me a fainting couch.  Sera, dear, whatever has your scattered mind conjured now?  Your failing-- among many-- is that you presume I desire approval. Power does not require that I be "liked."  If I might be so bold, Inquisitor, is this the company you would present as the Inquisition?  Thank you for illustrating the point.  It’s nothing personal, dear. I am demonstrably better than most. That you so thoroughly prove it is hardly my fault.  (laughs Oh, this is truly, truly sad.  Charming, darling.  That explains the letter of gratitude. They were, by all accounts, delicious.  You underestimate both the fragility of his holdings, and the severity of tribute demanded of him in the past.  Perhaps he was grateful it was not a stew made of some lesser cousin.  Ugh. Shall I assume you have altered my meals? Set the servants against me and encouraged sputum-based rebellion?  (Sighs. Rest assured, I will eat privately from my own stores from now on.  My dear, despite your egalitarian protests you are ever so susceptible to the opinions of others.  Of course not, coherent speech is your nemesis, but it is clear you care a great deal about what they /think/.  Take heart that you are not among the nobility, little Sera. You would not survive.  Of course not, dear.  Whatever are you on about now, dear?  We all have something we used to be, haven't "we," dear? Done things "we" would rather die than have known?  By all means, escalate, but I will answer in kind, armed with painful history I am sure is better left to your own sad memory.  My dear, I have not attempted to "bug you.".  I assure you, I have not.  Of course, Sera, dear. I understand completely.  Three keys to locks that have been changed, a schedule for a journey not taken, and two names of servants no longer employed.  The now-useless items passed to you by those in my employ. I do hope you have alternative plans for the evening.  I purchased more of a higher quality  Hmm? Oh, yes, my dear. Although I was rather well stocked with that particular shade of viper. So I sent it back.  Yes. It should make its way to you at some point.  I was most concerned it might have difficulty on the steps, so I gave it legs. Six of them.  Do you sleep with your mouth open? I should avoid that, it was heavy with eggs. Skitter skitter.  Skitter skitter skitter.  I assume you were properly impressed by Halamshiral? it is rare to be welcomed in the halls of power.  Oh, I will. And I'll be sure to entertain your requests for orphan salve or whatever you are championing on the day.  And I'll fill it just to watch you scurry from the gutter. Again and again and again.  Big vault. Little elf.  Sera dear, I couldn't help but notice you took to collecting spiders after the jaunt through Adamant.  Adorable. But manipulating fear is a touch more complicated than hoping Corypheus recruited a legion of arachnophobes.  Oh yes, we will be testing that in a most intimate manner.  I hope, Sera, that you have considered what damage your dalliance with the Inquisitor will do to her standing.  I didn't expect an invitation.  Yes, how utterly charming.  Of course Inquisitor.  So, an apostate?  Well, dear, I hope you can take care of yourself, should we encounter anything outside your experience.  You know, Solas, you do an excellent job of spellcasting without any concrete knowledge of technique.  I do prefer to have boundaries between myself and the demons, my dear.  Not at all! Many of them simply want to kill you. I suppose you would claim otherwise.  Solas dear, do you find your magic affected at all by the fluctuations in the Fade?  The same.  The Circle’s training in energy modulation is thorough. I sincerely doubt you could add anything.  Is that a problem, my dear?  Solas darling, if you wish instruction in proper magical attacks, do let me know.  I'm sure you know exactly what you're doing, Solas, but a word of advice?  You set your coattails on fire with that last spell.  (Laughter I would not claim your familiarity with the Fade, but I recognize fire when I see it, darling.  Not for you, perhaps.  I prefer to explore the world I actually live in.  Ah, the temptation to leave the path. You sound like a pride demon.  Oh darling, more than one already has.  Not at all, darling. You clearly have an exceptional gift for the Fade.  I'm far more surprised you haven't been murdered by terrified villagers wielding pitchforks.  It did, until a rogue apostate destroyed Kirkwall's Chantry and started a fight most mages did not want.  You must be pleased, apostate. Your rebels have won the favor of the Inquisition.  You must be pleased, apostate. With the Templars dissolved, your rebels will be most difficult to pacify.  You enjoy seeing yourself as a villain?  You must be disappointed, apostate. Your rebels have not found the freedom they hoped for.  And I will once again ensure they are protected from a world that hates and fears them.  You are too kind, my dear. But this age is still young.  So, apostate. If the Circle is such a failure, what would be your solution? Would you have your fellow mages live among the people, unguarded, unwatched?  And when they became possessed, or use their power to harm?  So you alone would pass judgment, repay murder with murder, or do we open this up to mobs and vigilantes? If you're going to dispense judgment upon violent mages yourself, you'll need eternal life and omniscience. If only there were individuals dedicated to finding and eliminating such criminals. Perhaps they might help?  Imprisonment is largely a matter of who holds the keys.  A compliment? Although you speak it as a curse.  What if keeping my power might in fact improve the lives of my fellow mages?  I need not be in spotlight. But after watching others try and fail, why should I not have a turn?  What rustic elven curse is that, apostate?  Darling, I have no idea what you might be implying.  Don't be absurd. Without magic, I doubt the Orlesian court would have interest in me at all.  I am pleased that such engagements were enjoyable for everyone. Even those with no grasp of subtle, social interplay might enjoy the pagentry.  Isn't everything?  I do hope you were not mistaken for a servant at the Winter Palace, Solas.  Yes, anyone who wishes to play the Game learns to use her servants effectively. Although I am surprised to see an elven apostate catch on so quickly.  The Grey Warden mages must be an inspiration, Solas.  Free of the constraints of the Circle, they have shown that they need no oversight to guide themselves...  Ah, but then they behaved rather atrociously. What a pity.  No, darling. You merely implied it, while offering no viable suggestions for improvement.  Corypheus is a complex creature. To draw upon so many different sources of power.  He has his own magic, he draws from the blight, the artifact he carries is elven...  And now, he uses a demon to create a false Calling to fool the mages.  This ancient magister is like a man drinking from three wineglasses at once.  You disapprove of Corypheus using the magic of the blight, Solas?  Yet you raise no objection to the Grey Wardens using blood magic?  I understand that Grey Wardens are connected in some way to the blight.  You must be pleased with what was revealed at the Temple of Mythal, Solas?  Now you know the elves were once a mighty nation.  I confess, Solas, I expected you to be back at the Temple of Mythal.  Some powerful magic yet remains there... if it can be trusted.  You explore the Fade to ferret out such secrets, do you not?  We are not so different after all, my dear apostate. We both believe magic must be limited safely.  You are too kind.  You should not encourage that thing.  Unwashed apostate hobo, more specifically.  They were in fashion for a while, you know.  Absolutely.  No need because it's hardly a secret, my dear!  (if in party Maker, how does she not know?  (if in the party Not over my tea kettle.
