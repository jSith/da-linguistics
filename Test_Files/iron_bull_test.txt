Oh, the old one? Man, he had an impressive rack. The new Arishok doesn't have horns at all. Usually means they're destined for something special.  That pretty much sums up the antaam, yes.  Oh, you've heard of us?  That must have been fun.  You don't say.  Hey, one time I ran across this dwarf on the road. Short, grouchy. You think you may know him?  Oh. Well... no. I don't know Tallis. Sorry.  Well, it's a pretty easy job. I do some fighting, and drinking, and then once in a while I tell Par Vollen about it.  If you do that, everyone knows you're a spy. Drinking, fighting, writing notes, that's all it really takes.  Still waiting for me to do something sneaky and spy-like?  Good! Because I'm supposed to ask about your friend Isabela.  Living the life. Unless you think I'm even more secretly a spy now.  Something like that.  Tolerably. Not a friend of the alliance.  Hey... we probably won't try to burn down a city this time.  So, your girlfriend is a smith.  She makes weapons... with her own hands?  That's hot.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry. That room is for her/him and me. No one else invited.  All right, now you're just making it weird.  Mm-hmm.  Could you make it sound angrier? "Love" is a bit soft.  Yes, that's better. Love is all starlight and gentle blushes. Passion leaves your fingers sore from clawing the sheets.  Hey, don't top from the bottom.  Hey, don't most dwarves have beards? Or at least mustaches or something?  You're a damn fine marksman. How do you manage that while staring up at everyone's ass the whole time?  You've ever get the asses mixed up?  So in your books, the stuff with the spies is all wrong.  That "Blue swan flies at midnight" stuff doesn't work. Most times, you pass information on the dead drop. No meetings at all.  Urgh... can you mess up the realism of something else? Like lyrium smuggling.  By the way, Varric, you write some nice fight scenes.  I figured that out when the good guy did a backflip while wearing a chain mail shirt.  Back in Seheron, I fell on a guy who tried to stab me in the gut. I felt the blade chip as it went through my gut and hit my back ribs. But I was alive, and on top. I sawed through the armor on the rebel's neck, back and forth, until it went red. I don't need a book to remind me that the world is full of horrible crap.  Maybe you should stand in front of me. I'd still have a clear shot at all the bad guys from the knees up.  Hey, Varric. You get that thing I asked about?  How do you guys live without this stuff?  Now I just need some hot milk and some of those Orlesian guimauves to put in it.  Steel Bull is already taken by a pit fighter in Antiva city. Thought about Veridium, but it turns out that there's two exotic dancers in Llomerryn that use that one. Identical twins.  Tavern in Rialto.  Well, I could have gone into textiles, but that sends the wrong message.  That's just the warriors. Ben-Hassrath use whathever tool's right for the job. Besides, didn't you name your crossbow after a woman?  It's not a secret. It's just too big for a quick chat. "Tell me about the Qun" is like saying "Tell me about economics". Most qunari know just enough to get by. It's like a blind dwarves trying to figure out a dragon by touch. Only the priests really have the whole picture. And they spend their whole lives figuring that crap out.  You know what I miss? Horn balm. It's impossible to get it out here.  Really? You got any?  (Grumbles. ...horns itching... (Grumbles.  Ah, these are the types of fights I love.  Every day back in Seheron I waited for a dagger in the back. Is that civilian secretly working for the Vints? Or is she just scared because she's caught between us and them? Here, the bad guys practically have signs. It's so much easier.  Hey, Varric, are you gonna write me into one of your stories?  When you do, make sure you describe the musculature right. 'Cause this isn't just endurance work—there was a lot of strength training to get here. You wanna use words like "rippling", or "ripped". "Ripped" is good too.  That hurts, Varric. That's hurtful.  Hey, Varric, I was reading your stuff... Where do your bad guys come from?  All right, that's really deep and all, but I meant where do the bad guys come from literally? The way you write it, it's like they just fall from the sky and land on top on the hero.  (Grunts. Lung exercises. Clearing the stale humors. It's a Qun thing.  Hey... some of us have to swing a giant hunk of metal instead of pulling our girlfriend's trigger from the back row.  Too close to home?  All right, but it was my line. You're gonna credit me in the acknowledgements, right?  Yeah, you do.  You know, Viv, you're not bad with that staff.  Oh. Right, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.  Uh, no. Odds are we're gonna be killing something again in a few minutes. Besides, the bloodstains are good for scaring enemies. They see a big, messy blade, and they, you know... Um... I'll go clean it.  Yes, ma'am.  Oh. Hadn't thought of it like that, ma'am.  Hey, I had a shirt in Halamshiral!  Well... all right, tell me more about the coat.  Waaaaait a minute. I know what this is. You're screwing with me because you look like a tamassran! It's the whole authoritative-female thing, plus that hat with the horns. You've been playing me! Well, I was trained by the Ben-Hassrath! You think I don't know how to handle manipulation?  (Sighs. Step, shuffle, spin, ma'am.  Are you sure you're not, maybe, just a little bit tamassran, ma'am?  All right, point taken. But you're pretty tall for a human. Maybe there was a Qunari there a few generations back?  You've got a point there. Usually the Qun doesn't even demand pants.  So, ma'am, you all right with the Inquisition bringing in templars?  So, ma'am, you must be pleased the Inquisition brought in all those rebel mages.  Your views of magic don't quite mesh with what I was taught about mages outside the Qun.  It's sad, mostly. The magic appears late in childhood, just like it does for you folks. Some kid's gone years learning to be a baker or soldier or builder, and then one day, that's all gone.  Well... yes. In theory, they're no different from anyone else. The tamassrans and the Ben-Hassrath protect everyone from their own mistakes. They're people too, just serving the Qun. But too many Qunari are afraid of them.  No. Anyone who takes that burden and lives a good life with it has my respect.  So ma'am, what do you think of Skyhold?  Well, I don't know crap about magic so if the Veil is thin, or its weak against demons somehow, I can't tell.  Ah. Got it.  All right ma'am, I get that Skyhold needs a fresh coat of paint.  But it looks good, right? With that silhouette, it's just daring somebody to try to attack it.  Well, that's why we have you and Josephine. And apparently marble sheaths.  So ma'am, with respect, all that crap at Halamshiral made sense to you?  But how does Orlais work with all the nobles screwing each other over like that? I mean, give Corypheus credit, if we hadn't stopped him he'd brought down the whole empire.  You really think Orlais works the way it is, ma'am? With all that infighting? All that selfish blowhards?  Well, that's one way to train your leaders.  So, ma'am, the Warden mages at Adamant, they don't have to be part of the Circle?  Not you though?  Well, after seeing what they did with blood magic, a nice strong Circle looks pretty good.  So, ma'am, you've been in the Fade, right?  Oh. Well, you're lucky then. It was awful.  Can you? Because it was more demons than I can imagine. And I'm quite good at imagining demons.  So, ma'am, you went into the Fade at Adamant, right?  I know, right! Glad it isn't just me.  Also demons trying to eat our souls. Really not sad I missed that one. We have more than enough demons outside.  So was it like that when you went through your Harrowing to become a Circle mage?  At least I don't have to worry from crap from the Fade trying to kill us anymore.  We kicked the Nightmare's ass! You gotta figure any demon is gonna think twice before coming after us now.  Oh for shit's sake.  You don't need to worry. I have no intention of trying to leash anyone.  I thought mages in Orlais didn't fight. You're more than capable with combat magic.  So, ma'am, with the magic, do you prefer fire, or lightning, or cold, or what?  I like cold, cause it freezes them, and then they break into little bits when I chop them in half.  So mages in the Circle really have to defend themselves against a demon?  (Grunts. Demons. That's messed up.  So what's it like shacking up in the Circle?  Well I assume people do it. And you're people. So, you have to have... I mean... come on, with those... just forget I asked.  I know! But the scar will look amazing! You see, it already sort of look like a wyvern's... (Sighs. I'll just put the bandage back on now. Sorry, ma'am.  I keep smacking my horns going through doors.  Uh... I may have done it a couple of times on purpose, to see if I can knock the frame loose...  We use Saarebas when we need to.  No, ma'am. Fighting with you is more like hitting an enemy while a dreadnought pounds their front line. All fire and smoke ahead of you-- half the enemies already on the ground by the time you get there.  I, uh, didn't mean to offend you.  Uh, no. No, I'm good.  Well, nobody fights well when their clothes are on fire... But honestly, I do really like the ice. Whatever works for you, though, ma'am.  I assume that... between living in the Circle and... wherever you live in Orlais, you don't get out much, ma'am.  Enjoying the great outdoors?  Yes, ma'am.  So, ma'am, what does the Circle know about Fade rifts and such?  Well, that's reassuring. You two just work whatever that is out of your system. Like poison. Weird-ass poison.  I really didn't ask.  Ben-Hassrath. Secret police. Spies, basically.  Is that so different from Orlais or Ferelden? They have all kinds of people policing them.  What you think is what you say and do.  How so? Last I checked, our mages weren't burning down Par Vollen.  Not really my call. I think most people everywhere have a system that works for 'em.  When that breaks, you fix it. Like we're doing now.  It's not that simple, Solas.  Alright, Solas, been thinking. You wanna know how this place would be if the Qunari took charge?  Orlais, Ferelden, all of it would be healthier under the Qun.  But the war to make that happen? That'd be ugly. A lot of good people would die.  So I'm not hoping it happens. There! You happy?  Oh, come on. I said I didn't want us to invade you!  Tell me something, Solas. Do you think the servants here are happier than the people living under the Qun in Par Vollen?  Choose? Choose what? Whether to do their work or get tossed onto the street to starve?  Sure, and good for him. How many servants actually go do that, though?  And then people feel like crap for failing.  When the truth is, the deck was stacked against them anyway.  And for every one who turns out alright, like him/her, and his/her parents, dozens go savage.  Most Tal-Vashoth are nothing more than savages. Killing's all they know.  The Ben-Hassrath are trying to lose fewer people to that sickness.  Watch it, elf. You haven't seen the Tal-Vashoth like I have.  Try watching a Tal-Vashoth kill a Tamassran and her kids. Then we'll talk.  Every day.  I'd kill some of them, they'd kill some of my guys, and then I'd kill them some more.  The ones that kill innocent people, yeah. The rest... I don't know.  So, Solas, you go into the Fade on purpose when you dream? Just to... hang out?  Yeah, but they're spirits. You can't treat 'em like people.  Uh, no, because Qunari don't go around trying to possess people and turn them into abominations.  Oh, come on!  So, you going to let me have it, Solas? Or do I get to wait and wonder.  We've got the alliance with my people. Given how much you love the Qun, I figured...  Hey. The Chargers died as heroes for the good of the mission.  Well that's a fuckin' relief.  I've always liked fighting. What if I turn savage, like the other Tal-Vashoth?  Thanks, Solas.  We don't, usually. It's pretty hot where we're from.  But I can get into anything with a loose collar. Just gotta ease one horn through and then angle it up.  There's a term for getting caught unprepared that translates to "running around with clothing stuck on your horns."  Nice job in that last fight, Solas. You really kicked the crap outta that guy.  What, you don't think so? You ripped him a new one. It was great!  I don't know. Gotta wonder about anyone who fights as much as we do and doesn't have some fun with it.  Yeah, but they were assholes!  Something wrong?  The baker with the squint and the red nose? Yeah, spy. Probably Venatori.  He watched all of us. A normal guy would focus on you, because staff, or me, because horns.  He had a dagger up his sleeve, which no baker needs, and the knot on his apron was tied Tevinter style.  I sent a message to Red. She'll investigate.  The good spies usually are.  You've got an odd style, Solas. Your spells are a bit different from the Circle mages or the Vints.  I've seen self-taught warriors. Even the good ones have something awkward in their style, something that clunks.  I don't get that from you. Maybe magic is different.  Hey, Solas, you ever do your Fade thing and pretend you can fly?  Just flap your arms and zip around in there? Then maybe bang some hot Fade ladies?  Aww. Demons shit up everything.  Well, this area's low on dancing girls, sadly.  You're shitting me. We don't even have a board!  (Grumbles. Smug little asshole. Pawn to E5.  Accepted. Pawn takes pawn. Give me a bit to get the pieces set in my head. Then we'll see what you've got.  Little aggressive. Arishok to H4. Check.  Pawn to B5.  You call your Tamassrans Mages? Ben-Hassrath to F6.  Ben-Hassrath makes more sense than horses. They're sneaky, and they can move through enemy lines. Arishok to H6.  Ben-Hassrath to H5. Hah! All right, take some time. Think about your life choices.  Arishok to G5. So, you giving up the Tamassran at B5 or the Ben-Hassrath at H4?  Pawn to C6. Left your Tamassran hanging out.  Ben-Hassrath to F6.  Hah! Pawn takes your Tamassran - or Mage, or whatever it is.  Too much time playing with spirits, Fade Walker.  Arishok to G6.  You're the one who lost his Mage. Arishok to G5.  Oh, clever. Almost trapped my Arishok. Ben-Hassrath to G8.  (Grunts. Arishok to F6.  Don't get cocky, you're still one Tamassran down. Tamassran to C5, by the way.  Arishok takes Pawn at B2.  Arishok takes Tower. Check. What are you doing, Solas?  All right, Tamassran takes Tower. Your last Tower, by the way.  Really. I've got my whole army bearing down on your King, and you're moving a Pawn?  Are you even trying anymore?  All right, Solas. I've thought about it. Ready to finish this? Ben-Hassrath to A6.  Uh-huh. King to D8.  And now my Ben-Hassrath takes your Queen.  You've got no Towers. You're down to a single Mage. Too bad you wasted time moving that Pawn to... to...  You sneaky son of a bitch.  (Grunts.. Nice game, mage.  You're not as flashing as most mages, Solas.  The Tevinter mages I fought in Seheron tried to scare us with what they could do.  Dorian looks like he's waiting for applause after every spell. Even Viv has this confident swagger.  Vivienne has this little swagger, like she knows she's the most dangerous thing in the room.  Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.  Not the quiet elven mage, though. No frills. Nothing to give you away. Half our targets never even see you coming.  If you like.  Solas, not the time.  (if in party Eh, depends how much rest the trees had.  Sera, I had a thought. The next time we run into a line of enemies, I'll pick you up and throw you.  No! This could work! I loft you over the front rank, and you land behind them to flank ... mayhem ensues.  Think of the mayhem, Sera! Mayhem.  Look, you and Varric are the only ones small enough and he's... pretty dense.  The Tamassrans? Terrifying... and inspiring. They teach you everything you need to know. Give your life purpose.  Oh, shit yeah.  (Laughs for a long time. Uh, no.  You, uhh, you aren't really viddathari material.  Because you ask questions like that.  Hard to argue, sometimes.  Hey, was that you back at Skyhold, with the custard?  It was beautiful.  Hey, Sera, you see the blonde a few towns back? She was easy on the eyes.  No! Well, yes, but…  What about the fancy bow on her apron, dangling all long and sassy, so someone could ease it open with one slow pull?  You have to see the little details to get the whole person, Sera. There’s a woman behind those tits.  Remember that red-head a few towns back?  Your loss.  Sometimes. Usually it's just against the wall.  She sort of asked.  It's just a friendly. I won't step in your business.  Relax. I don't want you lodged somewhere.  So, you and the Boss huh?  (Chuckles Hey, no hard feelings. Glad I loosened the lid for you.  Fine fine. Touchy.  Not the first time.  So, you and the boss huh?  Didn't think you were the kind to bed your way to power.  I stand corrected. So, you and the boss huh? Didn't think you were the kind to bed your way to power.  What? I didn't mean anything by it!  So it matters, huh? Good to know.  Sera, how did you get an entire beehive into Cullen's training dummy?  Wait, do you think it was that magic Cole does? Like he helped you and then made you forget?  Sera, How did you get an entire beehive into Cullen's training dummy?  But it's a beehive. Full of bees. Most people would pay attention.  You're really good with that bow, Sera. You lay down solid cover fire.  You really believe all this Andraste stuff, Sera?  Then you support the templars and their treatment of the Circles? All that?  Then you don’t support that Chantry.  All right, so you support the Chantry, except for the things that it...does? And this makes sense to you?  I think you're confusing. How can you just pick and choose what parts you believe in?  Or as normal people would say, real and not real.  Mythal was some crazy shit, huh?  Really? That's what off limits?  Quit it with the stinkeye. What's wrong, Sera?  But it's the same with your Chantry. Point is, a group needs rules, so you know sho's in and who's out.  Yes? And?  All right. Hit me.  Hmm. You standing or sitting?  Right, sorry. So we'd be like a mobile siege platform. (Grunts. Yeah... this could work.  Uh, sure. That's... not all the same thing. But all right.  And Halamshiral pissed you off something fierce.  We should get shirts. Probably need different sizes.  I think I figured out how you fight, Sera.  You don’t actually like thinking about hurting people, do you?  Chopping them down, making the blood spray...  Right. So if we hack them up, you have to do it without thinking about it.  I don’t know. I thought it was interesting.  You mean getting exiled from my people and declared Tal-Valshoth? Yeah, I should make a cake.  The Qun keeps our savage natures in check. Without it, if I lose control...  Thank you.  Yeah?  Oh, yes. Finding someone who needs killing and just taking them apart…  Brutally, skillfully, so their last living thought is realizing that I’m stronger and smarter than they are?  Yeah, I like that a lot.  I didn’t say it was healthy.  Look, I can either press those feelings down until I snap and hurt someone I care about…  Or we can go find some bad guys who need to die.  So, hey, Sera, a few fights ago, there was this one guy. I had his leg wounded, his shield down...  Yeah, see, I had him. I was winding up for the killing blow and everything. You didn't need to take him.  What I'm saying is, please stop stealing my kills, Sera.  All right, you're not stealing, you're helping. Kill-helping. That's fine. (Grumbles.  What? Why?  Is this because I like cutting people? You're trying to make it less tactical ad more... funny?  I'm not sure I get the joke, but... all right. "Flowerpot." You got it.  And thanks.  Hey, Sera, you see how I took that one guy's head clean off? Fantastic, right?  Really? You kill how many people, and one little decapitation bugs you?  No. No, I've never seen that.  This stonework is old.  And I don't mean just a couple ages old. We're talking old.  You think we don't have dwarven ruins up in Par Vollen?  My old tamassran saw this place, she'd rope it off until the scholars counted the grains in every block.  Why are the Venatori the first ones out here?  No, I mean why isn't Orlais or Ferelden sending scholars to learn how to make a building that lasts a thousand years?  This is real engineering. None of this "we'll get a mage to lift that block" crap Tevinter does.  Seriously, look at this place. Know why it lasted so long? Siege mentality.  It may be above ground, but the old dwarves built this city like a mountain might fall on it.  You learn a few things about walls after knocking enough of them down.  We're gonna waltz inside and pick up what's there?  Nah. Better us than the Venatori.  Think about what's missing in these tombs, though.  I've got a theory. Let's find the last one.  Probably. Good job.  Pits. Arrow traps. Anything to stop us besides a door.  They thought the guy they buried here was so important, no one would ever think of robbing him.  Exactly! It's downright Qunari.  Something's funny about you.  Yeah. You talk about Grey Wardens and honor and sacrifice and griffons, but you're still not convinced.  Yes, you know what I mean.  I'm a people person.  You know one thing I miss about Par Vollen? Bananas.  They're bigger, less squishy, and bendier.  Hey Blackwall. What's the most limbs you've ever cut off something in one swing?  Right. Same here.  Heads absolutely count.  Nice! Down on the collarbone and through, right? That's how I get the good ones.  Hmmm, Ben Hassrath, perhaps, if you prove yourself.  Oh. Laborer, probably.  Strong back, legs. And laborers are important. You can't have the Tamassarans doing the heavy lifting.  Really? You don't want to see our pamphlet, "Digging Holes and Filling Them Up Again"?  You're good with that sword.  I see all that time on your own has given you a firm grip.  "Blackwall." "Iron Bull." We could fight crime!  Oh yeah.  Oh, yeah. Tried it a few times. No luck.  A little. I'm big enough that I've gotta lean down to make it work on most people. You see it coming.  I did it once with a charge, though. Got a Vint on each horn.  Yeah, 'cept for the part where they were both hanging from my head yelling for the rest of the fight.  Hey, Blackwall, what would your ideal blade be forged from?  Nah. Bloodstone's great at holding an edge, but that sharpness leaves it brittle.  You may not have noticed, but I'm not a finesse fighter.  I guess I'd go with Dawnstone.  Yes... Really damn pretty, though.  It's pretty.  Hey, Furrows.  Yes. Furrows between the eyes. Moping. Lost in your own issues.  I'm not judging. I was gonna say you're pretty good at it. I can't pull that off.  And I mean, if you're going to brood, you might as well reap the benefits.  The ladies.  Sounds like joining the Grey Wardens is like following the Qun.  Service, hard work for a good cause, always knowing where you fit in, what you have to do...  Little surprised I got there before you did, big guy.  How does being a Grey Warden work? I assume it's more complicated than just signing up.  And how is it that you're the only ones who can end the Blights?  Curiosity. The Ben-Hassrath could know more about the Wardens.  Also, those ogre guys, the darkspawn that look like messed-up Qunari? The Ben-Hassrath aren't pleased.  Soundly, while propped up on a bed of oiled, writhing virgins.  If I did that, I'd just be telling people where to hit me.  As it is, every half-decent fighter sees the eye and thinks he can feint, then come in with a low stab.  Then I chop his head off. It's like a gimme.  It doesn't. But taking a blade to the ribs is a pretty good teacher.  I'm Qunari. We don't flinch from duty.  No.  Two key differences between you and me, Rainier.  First, I didn't kill a wagon full of kids.  My men were holding a position to secure an objective. I mourn their loss and honor their sacrifice.  And second, I'm proud of who I am. I hope that's not a problem for you.  Feels a bit like I've been living a lie, and now it's coming back to bite me in the ass. What's that like, Blackwall?  Well, you could've just led with that.  Yeah, I think I'm good.  Stings a bit. Thanks for asking.  Thanks, I appreciate the advice.  Yeah, I think I'm good.  You could've been one of the Chargers, Blackwall. You’ve got the stature, the attitude...  Hey, I'm a great boss. I’m a firm believer in No-Pants Fridays.  Why? Because you're better now? Because there's something wrong with working for gold?  The thing about my guys? They're honest with themselves.  You could've learned that lesson.  Hey, No-Pants Fridays is a cause.  Hey, No-Pants Fridays is a cause.  Now, isn't this better? Getting the burden of that lie off your chest?  Hey, I don’t hate you. You and me? We’re good.  Now that you know who you are, you can stop doubting yourself and start hitting crap again.  I used to think it was just me who thought you humans all look alike.  Clearly, you guys can't tell each other apart, either. How the crap did you live as some other guy for all those years?  Really? Puts some hair on your face, and no one can tell who you are anymore? That's some disguise, big guy.  All right, that probably helped.  Hey, that's some good armor.  Some high-ranking women wear ornamental crap with tits hammered into it.  One good shot, and all that cleavage gets knocked right into the sternum. Real messy.  Good on you for going practical.  Leaves something to the imagination, too.  Same here, Seeker.  Oh, now you're just being mean! I mean, roses! Who has sex smelling like roses? Violets, or a nice frangipani, maybe.  Put some horns on you, you make a pretty good Qunari.  You know, the Ben-Hassrath are a lot like your Seekers, Cassandra.  Maintaining justice in the ranks, operating under a veil of secrecy, investigating corruption and threats to the order, and you deal with it all so quietly. Most people never notice.  Well, keep at it! You guys will get there.  If a Qunari women really wants to fight and has a gift for it, she becomes an Aqun-athlok. The Aqun-athlok joins the warriors and is treated like a male. He becomes a guy, for all intents and purposes.  Doesn't matter. In the Qun, your role is everything.  Depends. In or out of your armor?  You know, Seeker, I really like hitting things.  I knew you'd understand!  Hey, Seeker, if I hit a guy high while you go low, you think we could get him to flip?  Yes. Ass over tea kettle, you know.  I've always wanted to get a guy to flip.  Your family's full of dragon hunters, Seeker?  So, when you face a dragon, does it get your heart pumping? Do you breathe a little faster, feel the blood racing?  (laughs No, seriously.  Damn...  So I hear you saved the last Divine from a dragon assault?  Nice!  Nah, I can see you don't want to talk about it. Bet you looked good doing it, though.  Thank you, Seeker. I'd be happy to teach you.  (laughs Then it's time for a rematch...  That was some solid work back there, Seeker.  The way you backhanded that guy with your shield and then damn near chopped him in half?  You and the boss should use that between the sheets.  Hah.  Any chance I could have the boss borrow your armor later? For, uh, personal reasons.  I'd clean it after.  (frustrated sigh  Hey, are you as turned on as I am right now?  That's probably impossible anyway.  You know, Seeker, your style doesn't have to be so defensive.  You've got armor. Let someone scratch the paint a bit. You can wind up for a shot that will really ring their bell. Some part of you wants to just cut loose. I can feel the frustration in your swings.  Hah!  Hah! I'd offer to help you get rid of that frustration but, you know... I'm in a committed relationship.  Hah, that's right! Let it out.  If you need any help with that frustration back in camp, let me know.  Apologies for giving offense. I will stop making invitations, Seeker.  Works for me.  Sorry about your seekers. It's tough when the ones who watch over us abuse that authority.  Always happens though. Nobody can handle secrets all day long without it getting to them.  If the problem's small, they turn a blind eye. Like I said, it happens.  How do you think I ended up here?  So, Seeker, seems you have a thing for Qunari men after all.  There you go again, Seeker, getting an eye full of inquisibutt.  He's not just an object to quench your desires, Cass. Make sure you undress him with your eyes... respectfully.  Your naked body. Well, I'm talking about it. Cassandra's just glaring and turning red.  Fine, fine... but she started it, all doe-eyed and crap. See, now he's ignoring us. You've offended him.  Well, then, go wild you two!  Sure.  I'd rather focus on--  Yes, it's true.  Awww, you're happy.  Jealous, Seeker?  Who wouldn't be? Look at these horns.  Yes, I know, right? Feel the envy.  They got the job done. You know it means to put the mission first.  I appreciate it. The boys would too...  And all we lost was our alliance with the Qunari.  Thanks, Seeker. The boys will be glad to hear it.  Looks that way...  The Seekers gave you rules to live by, right? The Qunari have the same, and now I don't.  It's.... alright. I've got my Chargers and I've got the Inquisition. I'm good.  So, you ever letting Blackwall off the hook, Seeker?  Alright? So that's a no.  Sure you could. You won't, but you could.  Not that he would.  No? Sorry, Blackwall.  Cullen's got those trebuchets for the assault on Adamant.  Cullen's got some of those trebuchets from the siege back at Skyhold.  Hey, Seeker, think he'd mind if I borrow one? Just for an hour or two.  Krem sews a bit; he made these stuffed nugs with wings. I wanna see how far they can fly...  See? This is why you're not in charge of morale.  Oh, shit. That would have been better.  Yeah. I go for the shoulder, a shot he trained to take on the armor. But, since he's a barman now and not a merc, he bleeds, flinches, and I trap the arm and break his neck.  I didn't do it, kid. It was just idle thought, in case it came up.  Do you not?  I was just thinking about-- Wait, you in my mind again, kid?  Yes, it was. I was in charge. Should've found a way to-- Hey, that's pretty good. We could use that!  Ben-Hassrath, Kid. We can use anything.  So Cole, you're a spirit...demon...thing?  Not fond of 'em, no. But you and I are fine as long as you don't do any weird crap.  Yeah, weird crap like that? Pretty much what I meant.  So Cole, you're polite, you're good in a fight, and your heart's in the right place.  I've got a plan. I think this could get you sorted out, get both feet on the ground.  Yes.... When we get back, you're going to spend an evening with a nice lady named Candy.  She's gonna lift a lot more than that.  So how was Candy? You two have a good time?  Well, that was five royals well-spent.  Well, I do now.  Hey, Cole. Quick! What number am I thinking of?  Twelve. The number I was thinking of was "twelve."  (Grumbles. Demon interrogators. Stupid idea anyway.  Sure did. Thanks for sticking the "the" on there, too. Most people forget.  It kinda makes it sound like I'm not really a person. Like I'm this dangerous thing, you know?  It kills the joke if you explain it, kid.  Yes. We give each other grief. It's a soldier thing. Doesn't mean anything.  I guess I can see that. Him, huh?  No, no. I just thought, since you do that thing where you see into people's heads...  Actually, you're good, kid. Keep it up.  Oh good, you're doing your thing again.  Well, then... what did he think?  Oh... yeah.  It's all right. I'm good.  Looks like my old Tamassran was wrong. Bet she's pissed one of her kids went Tal-Vashoth.  How could you know that? You've never even met her.  Well, that's, uh, creepy. But... thanks.  Most people do.  Well, that's flattering.  Yeah. Picked that up in Seheron. Gotta keep it separate. Out here, anything could be a threat. You kill 'em for the team, no questions asked.  When we're at the tavern or back home, it goes back to normal. People get to be people again.  That's when shit gets messed up.  Yes?  Listen, Cole. You might be a weird, squirrelly kid, but you're my weird, squirrelly kid.  Just don't make it weird. No full hugs. Maybe a one-armed slap on the back... at most.  You're a fast little guy, Cole.  Nah. Just as soon stand there and let 'em come to me when they're ready to die.  Hey, don't go around saying crap like that. I like killing.  Just... come on, kid. You're making it weird.  All right, Cole, so when we run into a big guy with a shield...  Assuming that actually means what I think it does, great!  Yeah. (Coughs. How's she/he feel about you saying this in front of everybody?  Do you mind, kid? If you take away all the mystery, it's not quite as hot.  Right! My mistake. Carry on, kid.  I'll tell you when you're older.  No, I won't.  The kid? Please.  Next time we're alone, I'm going to pin you down and do things your body won't believe.  (Clears throat.  Guess the Vints will be pissed with you running to warn everyone at Haven, huh?  Didn't see any rebel mages coming to do it.  Ah, see? Good on you. Way to join the underdogs.  Says the Vint. When we're fighting Vints.  Sure, usually when I'm being paid for it.  I'm here, aren't I? Man's gotta take his fun where he can find it.  That what you are? You people all kinda look the same to me.  I'd buy you dinner first.  Depends how much you keep yapping.  Hope you like the view.  Hey, butchering implies I'm gonna eat 'em. Most Vints are just gristle and fat in a red wine marinade.  Must grind your gristle the "Elder One" is some crazy Vint asshole, huh?  Guess he thinks the modern Imperium is a real letdown, too.  Hmm, yes. Priesthood's been trying to explain that one for centuries.  Nice work with the magic back there, Dorian. You're pretty good at blowing guys up.  Hey, whoa, let's not get crazy.  Dorian, you've been to Minrathous, right?  You ever been to that place in the Vivazzi Plaza? With the big, cracked bell hanging off the roof?  That staff's in pretty good shape, Dorian.  Do you spend a lot of time polishing it?  Better hike up your skirt, mage boy.  You trip on that bustling whatever, don't come crying to me.  You expecting that from the Inquisitor too?  Oh, pardon me. I thought you said no Qunari. Meaning we're all bloodthirsty savages.  You ever use that fancy magic of yours to burn down a dormitory full of kids?  (Laughs. Then I wouldn't worry. Lots of other people need a knife in the back first.  Dirty.  Think I know what your problem is, Dorian.  You see a man who's burned out, who left his people and entire life behind... and for what?  How's that mirror treating you? Pretty picture, isn't it?  Wait, wait, I'll flex a little for you. Make it easier.  Ehn. The usual. Water comes, water goes, but eventually the tides wear away the mountain. Blah, blah, blah.  Wait, you think we've been at war all this time?  (Chuckles. That's just force of habit. A real invasion's different.  Don't know. Someone to tell someone to tell someone it's on again, I guess.  Worked that out on your own, did ya?  You gotta keep the name simple, so the nobles get it. They pay us to fight, not to entertain at tea.  I do my best.  That you know of.  I did. After a while, the saddle just got too heavy.  Still stewing on it, hey, Dorian?  Why not tell everyone? Thought you wanted to take your fellow Vints down a peg or two.  (Grunts. Good point.  You like it.  Sometimes. You want to watch, don't you?  Human sweat smells like pork that's been sitting in the sun. Just saying.  Thought you'd appreciate that.  You see a member of the Beresaad in full armor, you run, because it's war.  Then they'd have to invade everyone. You're so bloodthirsty.  You doing all right, Dorian? I know family stuff can be rough.  Finding out you don't fit in with the people who raised you?  Having to walk away from everything you grew up with, knowing you've disappointed the ones who loved you?  Burning out so hard you have to leave everything you've known and start over?  I might know a bit. Takes a tough man to do it, too. So good on you, you big old fop.  What's the matter? Not enough slaves around to rub your footsies?  Quite the stink-eye you've got going, Dorian.  That's right. These big muscled hands could tear those robes off while you struggled, helpless in my grip.  I'd pin you down, and as you gripped my horns; I. Would. Conquer. You.  Oh. Is that not where we're going?  I'm just saying, Dorian. You have this picture of the Qunari in your mind.  Like you see us as this forbidden, terrible thing, and you're inclined to do the forbidden...  All I'm saying is, you ever want to explore that, my door's always open.  Good. I like that energy. Stoke those fires, big guy.  So, Dorian, about last night...  Three times! Also, do you want your silky underthings back, or did you leave those like a token?  Or... wait, did you "forget" them so you'd have an excuse to come back? You sly dog!  Speak for yourself.
