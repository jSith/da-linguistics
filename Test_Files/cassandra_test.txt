 Are you serious? Here, of all places we've been?  I assume you've heard about Prince Sebastian, Varric.  I wasn't trying to...  I thought you might be concerned. It is your home.  Have you heard from any of your Kirkwall associates Varric?  You're no longer my prisoner, much as you like to act like it.  I am not without sympathy, especially given recent events.  (sigh  How kind of you.  Leliana recruited Josephine. They're... friends.  I recruited Commander Cullen.  He has made no complaints about my manners.  Varric I'm sorry. About earlier. With the table.  I am sorry.  Perhaps not that sorry.  Varric, does Hawke ever autograph books?  Yes... but it could also have Hawke's signature on it.  Hawke's taller than I imagined.  Not the first thing.  It was research! I thought I might learn more about the Champion.  I already read that one. Twice.  I have enough mysteries and investigations of my own.  Then you killed my favorite character in Chapter 3, so I threw the book across the room.  Varric, how could you let the Knight-Captain be framed for murder?  But she didn't deserve it! You'd already put her through more than enough!  That makes no sense!  What made you write about Hawke? All your other books are complete fiction.  Yet your book is still full of lies.  Why is the second "Hard in Hightown" so completely different from the first?  By "editor", do you mean your crossbow?  Who does?  Is she alright? Is that how the book ends?  Cole, what happens to her?  (sigh Not all my feelings involve stabbing.  I am somewhat surprised you didn't follow Hawke to Weisshaupt, Varric.  What about Anders? Will he...  What about Fenris? Will he...  What about Isabela? Will she...  And Hawke's brother. He's still alive, isn't he?  And Hawke's sister. She's still alive, isn't she?  You would find a way.  About Hawke...  But what about Fenris. Does he...  You speak as though I could forbid it. I did not know your friend or see her Eluvian. If you have an issue speak with Lady Morrigan.  Varric, you are aware that I'm a candidate for the Sunburst Throne?  Not a single snide remark?  I don't look forward to your needling. But its absence is telling.  Am I to understand your Bianca is married?  Forget I mentioned anything. It was a simple question, Varric.  I would rather you didn't.  None.  This... is not a discussion I want to have here.  I have no "conquests".  No.  Very well, Varric. If you wish to know about men I have known, I will tell you.  You are right. I pried first, and fair is fair. Years ago, I knew a young mage named Regalyan. He was dashing, unlike any men I met. He died at the Conclave.  What we had was fleeting. And years had passed. Still, it saddens me to think he's gone.  I know. I was not trying to make you speak of Bianca. If I was, you would know. I would yell, books would be stabbed.  I still don't understand how drakes take that hand.  Isn't that a children's game?  Leliana's rank equals my own insofar as our rank means anything outside the Chantry.  I declared the Inquisition but I don't know that I'm best suited to command it. Perhaps you're interested in the position since you seem so interested?  There's almost no mention of your part in the Tale of the Champion, Varric.  You don't want to incriminate yourself, you mean.  I'm watching you, Varric. Just so you know.  Nothing. Yet. Just keep it that way.  Is there a problem?  (Laughs.  Why? Are you eager to see me go?  How do you know I wouldn't just drag you along?  Like fungus.  No.  No.  You do not?  Most Holy did not confide her plan to me. Perhaps she thought they were tired of death and conflict.  I will not mock a dead woman, Varric. She did what she could, and that is more than most.  How do you write as you do, Varric? I can never find the proper words.  I've needed to describe events in reports. They always come off as...  You... are an ass.  I hear reconstruction is progressing well in Kirkwall.  I wasn't trying to...  About its recovery!  I think it's time to stop playing the wounded party with me, Varric.  I did no such thing. I questioned you, and then brought you to Haven so you could tell your story to the Divine.  And ignoring the fact you did lie to me.  Do not pretend to be an innocent bystander - I could have done far worse, with full justification.  I thought she needed to see the chest hair for herself.  I thought she needed to hear it from the horse's mouth, as it were. I also knew she would ask you to help us.  A crazy thought, I know, yet here you are.  No.  Try to be quiet, instead.  Have you been taking notes on all this, Varric?  The Inquisition! You're not planning to write a book about us, are you?  I do not "rough people up."  You will never let that go, will you?    Dwarf...  I'm right here!  You do. Always.  Leliana and I were delayed returning from Kirkwall.  I'm not so certain. If we had only...  Thank you. But I suspect I will be telling myself that for years to come.  You are not from Orlais originally, Vivienne?  I ask because of your accent. I would have thought, once you joined the court...  I wish someone had told me that when I was younger.  I assume your parents were Rivaini, Vivienne?  You don't remember?  It was chaos. I would hardly call it "organized".  Being more flexible than the Chantry is not a difficult goal.  I cannot claim to have known her well. Few can, except perhaps Leliana.  Justinia was a visionary. The grand clerics would never have chosen her had they known her intention. And now they will never find someone to fill her shoes.  The Divine wanted a heroic figure all of Thedas could rally behind.  That was hardly single handed, Vivienne.  (Laugh, a perception that will last until the moment they meet me, I assure you.  I use it in the service of the Inquisition when I must.  How is manipulating and bullying people supposed to be enjoyable?  Were you not suggesting earlier I should be more intimidating?  If I am never invited to another Orlesian salon I will consider that a success.  Do you actually see me playing the Game, Vivienne?  Wearing ball gowns and painted masks, decking myself in jewels and courtesying to suitors?  I... never thought of it like that.  I've thought about what you've said before, Vivienne.  The ball at Halamshiral reminded me how much I hate all of it. Me? In a dress? It's ludicruous!  Oh not you too.  (Disgusted snort.  Oh not you too.  (Disgusted snort.  Of course *you* would say that.  They can keep their appreciation. I like my armor.  Exactly. I do not trust any event where hitting someone isn't an option.  I am when it suits me. Nobody expects a battering ram to wear a dress.  My thoughts exactly.  Vivienne, about you and Duke Bastien...  You were together for a long time?  Are you--?  I only wished to express my sympathy, Vivienne.  She is also an intelligent woman with strong convictions.  The decision rest in the hands of the grand clerics.  The Chantry needs to change and I would see it done, but...  If I am chosen, then I pray it is the Maker's will and not ambition that guides me there.  When I punched the wall, perhaps.  I did not realize it took so little to exceed your expectations.  They were all talking, weren't they?  (Frustrated sigh. Sweet maker.  Rebuilding is not enough. I would see the Seekers forged into something greater than what they were.  I fear the Seeker's time has passed, if there was ever worth saving, it is gone now.  Then let it be someone worthy.  Would that not be impractical?  I prefer the half that keeps blades out of my innards, personally.  I wanted him to testify about the events of Kirkwall to the Divine.  The Divine... also wanted him to autograph her copy of "Hard in Hightown."  It was a minor consideration. You should feel flattered.  I am ill-suited to finery, Vivienne. Besides, I can accomplish more as I am now.  I try to do the Maker's work. Where I stand while doing so is unimportant.  You've adjusted to the Inquisition quickly, Vivienne. We must lack many of the luxuries to which you are accustomed.  Skyhold is hardly the Orlesian court.  You've heard correctly. Necromancy is not uncommon in Nevarra.  I have always found the practice morbid. But the stories ones hear outside Nevarra... such fascination reveals far more about the teller than the truth.  You would prefer to have the templars return to guarding the circles, Vivienne?  Few mages would ask for templars in the circle.  Provided they fulfill their purpose. Too many have suffered since the mage rebellion began, but we cannot ignore the abuses that prompted it. Without change, we risk repeating the events at Kirkwall.  I'm aware. I'm also aware they grow larger with each retelling.  From what I've heard from so-called "witnesses," I have to wonder.  If I was someone else, perhaps. I simply did what I needed to do.  Solas, have you always lived alone? Out in the wilderness, as an apostate?  Would that not be incredibly trying?  That... is an excellent point.  I confess, Solas, I'm surprised you decided to remain.  Just the same, I wondered if you might leave now that we have a plan to seal it.  As you wish, though I cannot guarantee what will happen in the days to come.  I had hope. As did we all.  The war was going nowhere for either side. That they went at all showed that they realized this.  We shall never know now.  You so rarely call me by my name, Solas. Why is that?  Manners have not held you back on other occasions.  I've wondered  The Breach opened, we were scrambling and barely had time to think... and there you were.  You must not have been far away.  Hmm. Lucky for us, then.  What is it like when templars nullify magic, Solas?  And our powers drive it back, making this world harder to affect?  No one has ever accused me of reinforcing reality before.  It is interesting to hear a mage's perspective of our abilities, Solas.  I am taught my abilities come from the Maker. You probably think it silly.  I know my abilities do not come from the Maker, as I had once thought...  You believe in the Maker?  I did. The evidence seemed damning, given the lack of an alternative.  You also heard the voices at the temple - is it so surprising I listened to them?  The truth is more important than my reputation, and anyone willing to accuse me of weakness is welcome to try.  Have you never encountered templars before?  And they never caught you even once?  We would be dead if I did not.  Solas, did you ever considered reforming the Circle from within? You have both knowledge and wisdom. You could have made the difference.  You fear that they would have made you tranquil.  I suppose you are right. Repairing the damage done will take great effort.  You say you've witnessed past events in the Fade, Solas--or the memories of them.  But the Fade distorts reality. Surely it cannot offer a true reflection of what occurred.  It was never my Inquisition, Solas.  I do not always agree with the Inquisitor, but I know well that I'm not also always right. So, whatever regrets I have I will endure. The world needs a leader.  I did my part. But the power you describe was never mine to carry.  I know myself and I cannot be the leader we need. Thus, I have no regrets.  Your opinion of me must be very low to surprise you so often.  Solas, if you do not mind me asking, what do you believe in?  That is not what I meant.  You have seen much sadness in your journeys, Solas. Following the Maker might offer some hope.  I admit, I know little of their meaning, but I did not think it was possible to remove Dalish tattoos.  Then how---?  Of course, I should not have asked.  Now that they are allied with the Inquisition, the rebel mages are likely to enjoy more freedoms.  I thought you would be pleased.  Now that they have surrendered to the Inquisition, the rebel mages are likely to lose some of their former freedom.  Does that concern you?  Allying with the Inquisition is likely to give the Templars significantly more authority.  Does that concern you?  Agreed. When it is done, I promise what you have done here will not be forgotten.  Solas, the dragon Corypheus commands - could it truly be an Archdemon?  So what is it, then? A corrupted dragon, simply another darkspawn?  It makes you wonder if that's all the Archdemons themselves are  Solas, what do you think this Corypheus actually is?  But what of the orb he wields and the dragon he commands? This is no ordinary darkspawn.  How do you expect I might feel? Most of my life was dedicated to the Order. I did so much I believed was good in their name.  I assume you have advice?  I noticed, Solas, that you did not seem surprised by what I uncovered about the Seekers.  You think organizations to be inherently corrupt?  You make the Seekers sound like a mindless beast.  Solas, I assume you know it's possible to reverse the Rite of Tranquility.  I know of only one mage thus cured, and... he had no control of his emotions. He was distraught.  Do you think that would have passed? If the Tranquil are cured only to end up thus...  That may be a risk we are obligated to undertake.  I... am reminded of what I was told following my vigil. They said my abilities were a gift from the Maker, a reward for my faith and dedication. But it was a trick, wasn't it? A ritual no different that the Harrowing, simply magic...  Thank you, Solas. That... does make me feel better.  You don't think much of the Grey Wardens, Solas.  A harsh assessment–but after Adamant, perhaps not undeserved.  Solas, you heard of the spirit they encountered in the fade. Could it have been Justinia?  She helped the Inquisitor--as Justinia would have.  (Sighs. I suppose that is all we will ever know.  Solas, I am sorry about your... friend.  I knew demons and spirits were similar, but I did not know one could become the other so easily.  That might be true with a spirit of compassion, but what is the purpose of a hunger demon?  I had not considered how fighting in our world might affect the Fade. Is it always thus, Solas?  It is said that generals should avoid fighting in the same battlefield too many times...  What are you two talking about?  That's enough!  The simplest spell had you white as a sheet. I've shrugged off worse in practice.  I apologize. I could help if you're willing.  That I can do.  I take it you think I'm frightening?  A Seeker on the side of righteousness.  Sera, I'm sorry.  My family is nobility. I've been in Seeker training since I was six. I walked with the Divine. I've never considered what I must look like to someone common. I must indeed seem terrifying.  Pretty as her what?  They put Most Holy's portrait on plates?  Who? Oh, the Divine? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm not used to such... unorthodox displays of faith. Most Holy was a visionary. I served as her Right Hand, and would have done so as long as she needed me.  I just said, I served as her Right Hand.  I...You were right, Sera. I find I did not know Justinia at all.  Sera, about you and the Inquisitor...  If you are going to pursue this, make it worth it. Be happy.  Ugh, there is no need to tell anyone that.  Nothing so base as that!  I have faith the Inquisitor did as she/he felt best.  I did not say I had no problem. I said I had faith.  What are you talking about? My weapon is nowhere near--  I know what occurred in the fade troubled you. If you ever wish to talk...  Of course.  I know what happened at Adamant troubled you. If you ever wish to talk...  You're right. I do feel better now.  Having who on?  It really is. My family is as pretentious as it is large.  I have them stitched into all my clothes.  You will not answer that.  (Laughs.  Some things cannot last.  I hope so, too.  Perhaps this would be a good time to stop talking.  It's fine, Sera, but this isn't the place to discuss it.  Sera, I was speaking with Dagna recentlydid you take some of her tools?  Why did you have it in the first place?  What hinges?  That's comforting.  What? No! Why would I?  I am a Seeker in the service of the Divine. I am a warrior of truth.  Sera, why would you assume I should use my training to assault an animal?  No. No, Andraste did not specifically say one should not punch bears.  Sera, how are you not dead?  I was trained from childhood by the greatest swordsmen of the age. You were apparently orphaned to the street with your wits and a quiver. Neither full.  Andraste's what?  The eye is wreathed in fire. The Light of the Maker and the flames of Andraste's Sacrifice.  She was.  (Sighs No. No, there we don't go.  I'm conceding. I wasn't very interested to begin with.  Conceding. I'm giving up.  Very well. In Thedas.  Perhaps if you told me the rules?  (Sighs.  Here's a guess for you, Sera  Fine, then. Highever.  I don't really know Ferelden that well.  Another guess, Sera  That was the question that began this whole thing!  (Sighs, clears throat. Arse.  Don't you want to guess?  What does that even... I was born in a carriage halfway between Cumberland and Val Chevin.  So my brother claimed. Not quite the lap of luxury you were picturing, I assume.  Are we to know what that means?  If somewhat blasphemous.  I'm not saying it again, Sera.  (Sighs. "Into darkness, unafraid."  Maker preserve us.  Sera, I noticed one of my books is missing.  Cole didn't take it.  The one with all the illustrations.  You don't know how to ask permission first?  As Nevarrans we pay respect to the departed in family crypts.  Not in the way you're picturing.  (Sighs Well, now you know.  Is this another game?  I don't wear "underpants."  Sera, was there ever someone actually named "Red Jenny"?  You don't ever wonder how your organization got started?  That would be giving it too much credit, that's true.  Not every Pentaghast is wealthy. I certainly was not, once my parents were executed.  If by “dead” you mean a Mortalitasi necromancer--a keeper of the dead--then, yes.  Hence my joining the Chantry.  Sera, do you believe in the Maker?  I just thought, the way you've lived...  But you're a thief.  True, but... only those I must.  Moving on.  Ugh.  Are you referring to me?  I aim to please.  I enjoy fighting at your side, Bull.  But I will also enjoy returning to the base and sinking slowly into a steaming hot bath, sprinkled with rose petals.  (laughs  I'm not certain that's a compliment.  I highly doubt that.  Interesting, though we do not break the minds of our prisoners.  I am surprised you accept fighting at a woman's side, Bull. I understood Qunari women didn't fight.  But she wouldn't physically become male, surely.  And... do you think of me as male, then?  So I'd gathered.  Flip?  I... suppose that could be done?  It's something of a legacy.  What's the alternative? Relax and let it kill us?  I... feel no great calling in my blood. Sorry to disappoint.  (Sighs. Yes. In my youth. With help.  You're not going to press for the details?  (Laughs.  That move you performed in our last fight was well executed, Bull. I'm impressed.  If you had done it in our last sparring match, you might have won.  You, as well.  How do you know we haven't already?  No.  Absolutely not.  Am I what?  Excuse me?  How odd, since I'm feeling so much less frustrated as of late.  Unlucky me.  You'd feel far more if I actually hit you.  It's never going to happen.  I was not offended. Nor did I say you should stop, so long as we are both clear it's never happening.  Yes, it is.  How do the Ben-Hassrath deal with such problems?  And if it is too large to ignore?  Certain ones...  I don't know what you're talking about.  (sighs Thank you, Sera.  (sighs  (disgusted grunt  You are aware his/her room has a lock, Bull?  Some people might find that useful. In future.  Yes. I'm sure the room and its... contents... are very distracting. Thank you.  So, Bull, about Dorian...  If... you're both pleased...  (Laughs  Jealous... of Dorian?  I... see them.  Bull, what happened to the Chargers... you have my sympathy.  Yes, and I know what it costs those who live to see it through. The Inquisition will honor their memory.  I'm glad your men will continue to fight at our side, Bull.  I would not trade the Chargers for any alliance.  You are considered Tal-Vashoth now, Bull?  I admit I don't fully understand what that means, but... I am sorry.  I see.  He is a coward who abandoned his men. A man who wishes to atone but lies to do so.  I cannot help but feel as I do.  Not due to pestering, that's certain.  He cannot. Let us leave it at that.  I'm pleased it causes you so little trouble.  Why do you need a trebuchet?  I... don't think that's an appropriate use of the Inquisition's resources.  Why would you? They do not exist in Tevinter.  Once, we worked from the shadows, monitoring Templars and mages alike.  Your glibness does you no credit. The Mage Rebellion was beyond even our power to control.  I lied to you.  It... is why I left the Order, yes.  Your earlier judgment of the Seekers was unfair, Dorian.  And what would you say if one judged Tevinter solely on the actions of some of its magisters and slavers? Yes, let us dismiss your homeland as not having a single redeeming quality.  The Seekers failed, without question—but the situation was complex and you well know it.  Apologize to me? For what?  That is... remarkably decent of you Dorian.  Continue on this path and we'll see if it remains such.  Why does it matter? We are different in every possible way.  Your family of slave-owning Imperial magisters.  (Chuckles. Very well. There is that.  What does Corypheus hope to accomplish? Dorian, you must know.  Well, you have better insight into the Tevinter mind than anyone else here.  Do you truly think the Venatori have no idea what Corypheus will do?  Could he be convinced of the truth?  It is, although I'll not ask how you heard that.  I'm surprised they use the Rite in your homeland at all.  The reversal process is not simple and must be investigated... but yes, it will have implications here and abroad.  The Pentaghasts are a large clan, Dorian. I cannot know them all, nor would I want to.  Oh. I do know him  I take it your father returned to Tevinter, Dorian.  My father died when I was very young. I barely remember him now.  I understand. You have my sympathy.  I am not smiling.  I am not a giddy schoolgirl, Dorian.  You're smiling a great deal these days, Dorian.  Do you always do it while staring dreamily into the distance?  You're not as handsome as you think, Dorian.  Anyone who claims it as often as you must be dreadfully concerned they're not.  If the Archdemon survived a fall into the Abyssal Rift, I wonder if it can be slain.  What do you mean?  Meaning what? It cannot be slain unless he is?  We've seen that Corypheus is immortal. Does that mean they both are?  You undoubtedly saw more of it than I ever did.  They're dark. And full of undead. And the smell of stale incense still makes me want to vomit.  Of course. The Mortalitasi lure spirits to possess every corpse buried there.  Only in the abandoned areas. The rest are sealed up in their tombs, I suppose.  After a time, the moaning grates on the nerves. Trust me.  I suppose you prefer to see a man in the position.  That would be less amusing should it actually come to pass.  I don't want to think about that right now.  It seems anything is possible these days.  We do not engage in pitch battle for the position as you do in Tevinter.  Indeed. The slaughter occurs after he becomes Divine.  Why are you looking at me like that Dorian?  (Disgusted noise Keep wondering. If my uncle couldn't put me in one, neither shall you.  I don't have any control over how I'll be remembered.  Blue scarf? Why would I be wearing such a thing?  I'm not still a Seeker.  Yes. I would absolutely drag you there. Without question.  We hear odd stories of Templars in the Imperium, Dorian.  I haven't even told you what I've heard.  Oh. I was leading towards that one actually.  My uncle did, waves of them – until I broke one's arm. Then there were fewer.  It was an accident. Well... mostly an accident.  If you are to fight alongside us, Cole, I expect you to follow orders. The Inquisitor believes you wish to help, but I will not allow you to threaten innocents.  Do not doubt me. I will do it.  You're... serious, aren't you?  You knew Lord Seeker Lambert?  You... killed the Lord Seeker?  I... am uncertain whether to believe you.  Cole, do you have any proof about what you claim Lord Seeker Lambert did?  But he could have been brought to justice. There are rules...  You had a friend?  I... don't even want to know what that means.  I have considered what you said about Lord Seeker Lambert, Cole. If it's true, then perhaps he deserved to die.  Though it need not have been you who killed him.  It is not that simple.  We thought Lambert was assassinated. It made the rebellion worse, and many people were killed.  (Sighs.  Cole, you killed Lord Seeker Lambert so he wouldn't hurt people.  Is that why you went to Therinfal?  Perhaps we should think of something more... pleasant.  Yes, like that.  Why do you look at me when you say that?  We do not need to speak of this further.  Please, stop.  Thank you, Cole. I appreciate that.  So, Cole, you've forgiven the Templar who... killed you?  I think that's the first time I've heard you admit anything is complicated.  What the Templars did to you, to the real Cole... I knew the treatment was harsh, but...  Whatever happens in the future, there will be changes to how Templars and mages govern themselves.  The Inquisition may have a say in such changes. I... would appreciate any insight you might have.  I'll take it. I'm not promising to follow it.  What made you change your mind?  I try, but don't always succeed. You do your best, and have faith it will turn out as it should.  You may regret that notion, but I wish you well.  So, Cole, Varric tells me you were a spirit of compassion.  How does compassion become such a deadly killer?  Ah. I'm truly sorry.  What is it, Cole? Why the odd looks?  Ah, yes. They are delicious, but do not last long.  Sometimes it's difficult to accept the kindness of others, but it can be worth the effort.  So, Cole, I understand you are safe from binding now.  Fear of falling?  Perhaps I do at that.  What the Templars did to you, to the real Cole... I knew the treatment was harsh, but...  Maker's breath!  Whatever happens in the future, there will be changes to how templars and mages govern themselves.  The Inquisition may have a say in such changes. I... would appreciate any insight you might have.  What is it, Cole? Why the odd looks?  Ah, yes. They are delicious, but do not last long.  Just because they don't see you doesn't mean it isn't theft.  That takes no magical gift to understand, Cole.  The same could be said for Lambert or Lucius. A single moment of perfect faith does not make one immune to fault.  "Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just."  I knew the story more than the man/woman.  Perhaps not. Sometimes knowing that isn't enough.  Be easy, Cole. I will be fine.  Cole!  That's not the song they were playing.  What do you mean?  I believe it may have been safer, but we cannot know for certain.  We must pray that it never comes to that.  The Wardens fell. The Inquisition need not follow suit.  Then we must be vigilant.  Thank you, Cole... I think. I never met Clarel, but I will take that as a compliment.  Thank, you, Cole. I appreciate that.  What of magister Erimond? Do you sense a secret pain in him?  (Laughs. Well said.  Please leave my mind, Cole.  I do not feel bad. The bandits needed to die.  Thank you... I suppose.  No.  My... who are you talking about?  It was fine work. I will remember to thank him when we are back at Skyhold.  Was that a question? Am I supposed to?  Ah, the Grand Necropolis. Yes, I never saw the point.  I would rather not think about that.  Picked that up from my head, did you?  Stop going into my quarters. How many times must I tell you?  Cole, I found a locket on my pillow earlier...  It was my grandmother's, actually, but it had Anthony's portrait inside. I thought I'd lost it.  Oh? Thank you.  No one to concern yourself with.  Now I'm thinking about something else. Can you guess?  I am very pleased you joined us, Warden Blackwall.  We need strong, righteous warriors-now more than ever.  True, yet you give yourself to an Order that would die to protect others.  It is never too late to do better, and become more than what you are.  I did. I still miss him sometimes.  I'm sorry.  Much like her brother, I would expect.  Yes, not that it concerns you.  Is that a true fact, or another fabrication?  If you even think of saying she’d be like me, I will hit you.  (Chuckles Ahem.  Why? You can take it.  (Laughs. I did not realize you were made of glass.  I still my mind and focus my thoughts on the Maker.  I ask for His guidance. I ask to be reforged into an instrument of His will.  What about you? How do you center yourself?  Well, that's...  I understand Loghain is not highly regarded in Ferelden despite his efforts against the Blight.  He doesn't deny the claims, but I'm not certain he accepts them, either.  Forgive me. He is your comradethat was insensitive.  I wanted to join the templars, but was given to the Seekers.  I wanted vengeance at first, but I discovered a deeper joy in duty.  And some never find it. We are both lucky.  And how did you join the Wardens?  There is no such thing as a "usual" story.  There is more to this, you just don't want to tell it.  Seeker Cassandra, if you must address me.  But I would rather you not address me at all.  A man who truly aspired to be righteous would not lie.  He would earn respect, not steal the respect due another.  That whetstone you lent me - it produces a remarkable edge.  Thank you. That's very kind.  That won't be necessary.  What is it?  I have other duties.  Why not ask Iron Bull? He is always willing to hit something.  Yes, and if you joke about the Right Hand not knowing what the Left is doing, I will punch you.  Majestic? Say that after you see a pile of dragon shit bigger than your house.  Only the Maker knows everything about everyone, but it doesn't hurt if people believe it of Leliana.  It keeps people honest. Besides, if there is anything to learn, Leliana will learn it. I've seen her work.  What is the matter with you?  You’re favouring your right arm.  You are still a part of the Inquisition, and you continue without complaint. So long as you serve, I would not see you injured.  What are you talking about?  Evidently.  You’re seeing things.  I do not hum.  I see the Inquisitor kept you around. I would not have were it up to me.  Is it? What do you know of me? Even less than we know of you.  You have no right to determine what is beneath me. Not now not ever.  As you wish. I was going to pursue it no further.  It isn’t meant to be. And it ends here.  Former apprentice. Daniel completed his training with me years ago.  What makes you think I would welcome your pity?  I…you are right. He was a good man, thank you.  Daniel had raw skill; everyone could see it (laughs. He knew it himself.  You would think so, but no, he was attentive, to the point of irritation at times. He was under the impression that I had something to teach him.  He was.  Alistair speaks highly of you Blackwall.  You knew his mentor, Duncan?  What was he like?  I should ask Mother Giselle to hold a service for Alistair/Loghain. We must honour his courage, and his sacrifice.  You should attend Blackwall.  You pretended to be a Warden long enough. You should pay respect to one who actually served.  Would you join us Blackwall? One of his own should attend.  Stroud shares your reserved nature, Blackwall. It must be a common trait among Wardens.  At times.  Keep trying. I’m certain you’ll get there.  Plenty.  Uh, I, suffered from hay fever when I was small. My brother joked I should punch a tree in retaliation, so I did, and the sneezing stopped. I’ve done it ever since.  I cannot place your fighting style, and I have studied the martial arts for years.  How do you stand the Skyhold stables?  I can’t imagine finding "quiet time" in that stench.  They’re not horses. They’re dung monsters with hooves and tails.
