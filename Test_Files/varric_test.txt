 You were saved from the explosion that leveled a mountaintop, and fell out of the Fade.  You traveled through time. (or You fought a demon inside your mind - in the middle of a pitched battle between templars.  Faced down one of the ancient magisters who started the Blights. Had a mountain fall on you. And lived.  Single-handedly saved the Orlesian Empire.  Stopped an army of demons.  Whatever in the Maker's name happened in the Temple of Elfy Shit.  One of those things would be impossible. All of them together? That's a miracle.  Ever notice that for a people with no mages, dwarves use an awful lot of magic?  Personally, I think it's some kind of compensation thing./Maybe. I think it's a compensation thing.  We can't spit lightning or freeze anyone's ass off, so here, have a rune that sets your sword on fire.  Have you been reading the inscriptions? These dwarves built a colony on the surface. On purpose.  Exactly!/Exactly. You know what the Shaperate would think about this place.  "Real" dwarves don't like the surface. "Real" dwarves say leaving the Stone is death.  Whoever built this didn't give two tin shits about tradition.  Looks like these ruins are dedicated to a Paragon. That accounts for a lot.  It's... hard to explain. Paragons don't sound impressive on paper. So you invented a new hat or table saw. So what?  But when they come through, they're like an avalanche.  Dwarves wait entire generations forugh. You know what? Let's find that last tomb./This entire conversation is making me think about dwarf shit. Let's just find that last tomb.  Me either, but come on. Even surface dwarves get dewy-eyed when you talk about them.  We like to think we're different up here, but mention Paragons andugh, let's find this last tomb./This entire conversation is making me think about dwarf shit. Let's just find that last tomb.  This place is making me think too much about dwarf stuff.  Probably similar to what's in the last four.  You know, I don't buy that stuff about dwarven ancestors living on in the Stone, and we're above ground anyway.  But something about this place gives me the creeps.  I didn't say it made sense. Just that I'd like to leave and never look back.  (Sighs. You're holding the legacy of a Paragon. Empires used to kill for them. Heck, they still do.  Whatever it does, it's probably ancient and invaluable. So try not to drop it in the sand.  You want an encyclopedia entry, it may as well be from someone charming.  I'd also like to avoid falling, if we're counting votes.  Nothing's stopping us from going back up.  (Sighs. Just a suggestion.  My guess is another earthquakethat hits when we're halfway across the bridge.  (Chuckles. I just became the most popular dwarf in the Merchant's Guild.  She's stronger than you.  I once met a Grey Warden who got possessed by a spirit and then blew up a chantry and killed a hundred people.  What makes people think you want to hear what others of "your kind" have done, anyway?  So it was just you, alone in the vast wilderness?  The lone wanderer, searching the world. What's he trying to find? Love? Absolution?  Yes, but what does that represent?  You're just like Sebastian.  Let's talk about your dark and troubled past.  Well you have one, of course. Someone dear to you? Someone you've failed to save? Or a grave error in judgment, causing too many deaths? I've known a couple of people like that. Ooh, maybe betrayal! That's always good.  Well you've got to give me something.  Hm, touchy.  You remind me of someone. Pious bastard, wore blinding white armour. Told me my shots veered left.  It's just... all that niceness. He was just so... nice.  Sebastian would have taken that as compliment.  Absolutely true. She's still there, bringing an extra dose of horror to gallows tourists.  And make it impossible for children to play "Who's Brave Enough to Poke Meredith?"  No. No one's brave enough to poke Meredith.  And you only read some?  It's the dive. Filled with the best and worst people in the world.  Haunt? It was home.  All right, Hero, what do we talk about?  You don't want to talk about yourself. I can respect that. So what do we talk about then?  I'm a Free Marcher, remember? We invented jousting.  It is! Before us, no one ever thought to push people off things with large sticks. Historical fact.  Her victory in the Grand Tourney of Tantervale is pretty legendary, but I'd have to go with Reeve Asa. Winning three consecutive Grand Tourneys? Who does that?  Hey, you know they're holding a grand tourney in Markham soon. I think we should all go. Inquisition road trip!  I'll talk to Josephine, I bet she could pull some strings.  That depends entirely on who's writing the legend, Hero.  Oh, she's easily the most skilled. That's a fact. It's just "scrappy" is better than "flawless." I like heroes who try their damnedest, even if they fail a lot. It's easy to be valiant when you always win and everything goes your way. There's nothing great in that.  Bianca does most of the work.  Too attached to hitting things with your fists?  I'll stick with bows. I really like having my own teeth.  Have a name for the sword?  Go with Pokey. You seem like a Pokey. You seem like a Pokey guy.  How do you like being described? As "grizzled" or "masculine?"  No, I was just being polite. Going with "grizzled", then.  Alright, worst thing you've ever eaten? I had this imported ham for Anderfels once. It tasted like despair, literally.  Ooh! That's a tough one. I think I have to go with "The Neighbour's House". For sheer balls.  Maybe I've been too hard on you.  Actually, I thought you were boring before. Completely different. We're all dreadful. Every one of us, fundamentally flawed in a hundred different ways. That's why we're here, isn't it? Take all the risks, so the good people stay home where it's safe. With the whole "Blackwall" thing, you told a story so compelling even you started to believe it.  A story-teller's got to believe his own story, or no one will.  Cassandra still not speaking to you?  Well, she does hate it when people lie to her. At least she didn't stab you in the book.  No, I mean the book. Definitely the book.  I know this is a radical suggestion, but have you considered just... talking to her?  Well that would depend on whether or not I was there alone.  Just try "Hello"!  So... Hero, you and Josephine...  Oh, content to pine in silence, gazing at the dear ambassador from afar!  I could help, you know. Nothing stirs the heart like a well-written word.  Oh... yeah. Bad idea. Let's just forget I said anything.  I know he invaded Kirkwall. Are you going to blame me for that, too?  You weren't trying to remind me how bad it is in Kirkwall? So you decided to talk about it?  Of course I'm concerned! I don't need you prodding me with a stick to prove it.  You're asking me? So you don't read my letters?  Yet I still get all the suspicion.  Why, Seeker, I would never accuse you of having sympathy! By the way I tend to refer to my "associates" as "friends". Maybe you're not familiar with the concept.  You know, Seeker, for someone with your tact and charisma you assembled a... pretty good little Inquisition. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you didn't drag them all here by force.  I mean, you never know, you could have kidnapped Ruffles and she'd be too polite to say anything.  So there's a rational explanation after all. Just when I thought you had layers.  It makes sense that Leliana did the recruiting when the Inquisition started. Not everyone can be intimidated into signing up after all.  Lucky him.  His last boss was a raving lunatic who turned into a statue. That's not a high bar.  Beg your pardon? I didn't catch that Seeker.  Oh! I'll mark this on my calendar—Cassandra had a feeling!  Why? Doesn't your copy of the "Tale of the Champion" have a big hole in it?  ...cough. That's the first thing you said to him/her isn't it?  Tell you what Seeker. Next time you make me tell a story at knife-point I'll make the hero sound taller.  Seriously? Swords and Shields? How did you find that serial? Scrape it off the bottom of a barrel in Dust town?  I did write a book about the Champion. You might remember it. Had your knife stuck through it last I saw.  I can't believe you picked the absolute worst of my books to read. Why not Hard in Hightown?  What? You don't want to solve more in your spare time?  Ah, a critic. Say no more.  Well I did spent three entire chapters setting it up.  Look seeker, if you love a character, you give them pain, ruin their lives, make them suffer. Maybe even throw in a heroic death!  But you care enough to argue. If she has a nice afternoon and took a nap you'd stop reading.  Someone had to set the record straight about the Champion.  Ah but true ones! That's important!  (sigh Because I didn't write it. Shit, did you pay actual coin for that book? One of these days, I'm gonna find the duster who wrote that garbage and introduce him to my editor.  No my actual editor! Best in the business. She runs half the Coterie in Kirkwall, stickler for grammar. She once killed a man over a semicolon. I'd never print anything without her.  (sigh Good job, Kid.  Not anymore.  I thought you'd have some, um.., "stronger feelings" about Templars joining the Inquisition, Seeker. Feelings that involve stabbing.  Oh... so you reserve those for me, then! Don't I feel special.  There's a lot of work to do, Seeker. We'll catch up once this is all over.  If he's still out there, and Justice hasn't driven him nuts, Hawke won't be able to keep him away.  Oh he'll go. Once he gets my letter and after he's finished brooding.  Join her/him? Once she gets my letter she'll go whether Hawke likes it or not.  Aveline took him off somewhere when the Calling started going nuts, but he'll tag along—he always does.  Still alive, still a templar. He'll go as soon as he hears. Can't let Hawke have all the glory.  Aveline took her off somewhere when the Calling started going nuts, but she'll try to keep Hawke out of trouble. Better be.  Sunshine will go. As soon as she hears. I'm sure of it.  Hawke would rather we stay away, stay safe. That won't fly forever. Besides, if I went to the Anderfels, how could I annoy you?  Don't, Seeker. Just... don't.  He knows. I sent a letter. Leave it be...  You may recall, Seeker, that a friend of mine had one of those Eluvians. It didn't end well. Are you really going to allow one in Skyhold?  Um... No. I'll pass.  So I heard.  What?  The thought of you as Divine is scary. I'm hoping if I ignore it, it'll go away.  Oh have we reached the state where we gossip about each other's love lives? Did you hear that boss? Don't worry, I'll tell you whatever she says.  There was nothing simple about it.  You brought up Bianca, Seeker. Does that mean I could ask about your "conquests"?  No tantalizing secrets to divulge?  So no one within say, a, five foot radius has caught your eye?  (laughs Are you blushing, Seeker? Maker the world is really coming to an end.  Spoilsport.  Nothing? You do know he's standing right there...  How about dalliances? Liaisons? Illicit affairs?  Is it Buttercup? Is it?  Look, Seeker. I was only...  ...oh.  I'm sorry.  Look, Seeker, I didn't mean to make you talk about your mage friend.  (Chuckles. I'll keep that in mind.  ...hmm. Maybe we should start you on Shepherd's Six.  Yeah.  So as a Seeker, you're the highest ranked person in the Inquisition. But you're not in charge.  But you want to get shit done, right?  Oh no you don't. Leave me out of that mess.  Hm.., I don't want to bore people.  Oh... same thing really.  Well, that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. What'd I do now?  Varric Tethras, Paragon of Good Behavior, at your service, Seeker.  (Sighs. Is even terrain too much to ask for?  You might be used to traipsing through the countrysidepunching dragons, interrogating people, or whatever it is you did before this.  I'm from the city.  Think you'll ever go back to Nevarra, Seeker?  I wasn't, actually. But, now that you mentioned it...  Be still my heart. I've grown on you.  I spy...  But...  (grunts Well you should be good at finding things. Of course, you ...couldn't find Hawke.  Did you really think the Conclave had a chance of making peace, Seeker?  What was the Divine's plan? Bring everyone together and hope really hard that they would all get along?  Oh when is that ever been true? For Templars or mages.  You. Write. Really?  Dry? Boring? Lifeless? Stale?  Just... helping you find those words.  I know things are bad there.  You weren't trying to remind me how bad is it in Kirkwall? So you decided to talk about it?  What you're talking about are the buildings, and even then that will take years. People don't recover so easily.  Ignoring the times you actually wounded me?  What then? "Thanks Varric! We believe you! See you around!"  Yes, thank you for not torturing me. I'm so much happier now.  You never did tell me why you dragged me to Haven, Seeker.  I mean, what could I have told the Divine that you couldn't say yourself?  Er... Say again?  Help the Inquisition? Me?  Oh, come now, Seeker. I'm just trying to be friendly.  You'll need to be more specific there, Seeker.  Don't get your hopes up. You're not that interesting a subject.  And call it what? "The Wayward Magister?"  You know, Seeker, I thought you'd take charge back in Redcliffe. Maybe grab Fiona and rough her up.  Sorry, my mistake. You'd have your men do it for you.  Probably not.     So you could make people not see you, Cole. Can you do that for other people?  Hm, what about things? Can you make people ignore an object?  Oh, I don't know. A book, or a box... or a crate... or a wagon full of crates?  I'm just asking!  Who are "they," Kid?  It's the hat. Kind of hard to miss. Don't worry about it.  That's going to take a while. I'll explain "clothes" when we get back.  Nah, if they're busy staring at your hat, they're ignoring all your other flaws.  Exactly! If you can't be flawless -and no one can- be flashy. Nobody will know the difference.  How are you holding up, Kid? You've been quiet for a while.  You're doing fine.  Maybe not so fine... Don't talk to them, Kid. Just tie them in knots.  I'm glad to hear it, Kid.  Okay, delving into my personal life is one thing, but a writer needs some privacy.  So, Kid, why human?  Huh. Most people don't pick a shape. I guess I was hoping for something deeper with that question.  Well that's... deeper. I think.  Hey, Kid, back in the last village that farmer was looking past you. Why didn't you let him see you?  Maybe not, but you could learn something by talking with him.  You could learn not to scare them so badly that they have to forget you.  Who, Kid?  Most people are like cats. They either puff up to look dangerous or they crouch down and hope you don't see them. You show them you're not a victim or threat, and they're in your lap and purring before you know it.  That explains a lot.  How are you feeling, Kid?  All right. Well let me know if you ever... yeah.  Yep, that's her, Kid.  Nn, get the readers invested and you'll have them forever.  I've got fans in the Fade? Well, that's something. Shame I'll never meet them.  I'm... not sure what that even means, Kid, but probably?  Hey, Kid, what would a pride demon say to weaken a warrior's resolve? I need something that gets under her skin.  One of the big two-handers.  Well, that went a little dark. Who's "him" in this?  No, it works great. Just glad you're not that kind of demon.  Okay, Kid, try it again like we practiced.  Focus, Kid, you can't beat four of a kind with bad memories.  Nouns, Kid. Does who ever stop talking to me?  If they stopped I wouldn't have to write so much.  Alright, Kid, let's see what you've got.  Who's there?  Cole who?  No, no. You're still not getting it. Sorry, Kid.  Okay, I'll buy it. Who's there?  The Inquisition who?  Er... yeah. That's not working either. You didn't get that one from Sera, did you?  Okay, try it again, you'll get it.  Who's there?  (Sighs. Me who?  Um... that was... closer keep trying.  So, Kid, you don't have any formal combat training at all?  ...er. Whatever works for you.  Sure, why not. Who's there?  Dragon who?  Sorry, kid. Still not quite getting it. Closer, though!  I could ask the same thing of a pampered, noble Tevinter.  Talk to Josephine. She can arrange something.  You aren't asking me to give odds on our beloved Inquisitor's success!  In his/her favor?  I agree. So morally reprehensible to bet against your own side.  Brave man. We'll talk later.  What's wrong with sparkler? Not colorful enough for you?  I have the eyes of a story teller. It's a gift.  See? Embrace your place in the universe, sparkler.  Yeah, well, what can you do?  I've had to write some letters. Let's not talk about it.  How are you feeling about that bet now, Sparkler?  You're crazy! We're beating Corypheus everytime we turn around. He's on the run!  Heh, if he crunches us, you'll be dead.  Shouldn't you be married off right now, Sparkler? Have little magelings running around?  Had someone lined up for you, huh?  Sounds like you two would have made a happy couple.  What do you think, Sparkler? Ten royals says the next thing we run into farts fire.  I tried to warn you.  Yeah?  Yeah…  Planning on settling that fifty crown debt anytime soon, Sparkler?  Oh, I don't know. I suppose I could always send a letter to your family...  I see you eyeing Bianca, Sparkler. Hands to yourself.  Huh. And here I thought you're a man of refined taste.  Contraption!? Don't listen to him, sweetheart. His people are vilified for a reason.  What? No! Why would you even ask that?  Just because two people dislike each other doesn't mean they're about to kiss, Sparkler.  Don't mistake me for that hack who wrote Hard in Hightown II. I can spell.  So, Sparkler, what do you think of the Inquisition so far?  Five royals says you see something weirder before the day ends.  I got to ask, does any of this shit make sense to you?  Either. I'm feeling generous.  Corypheus is that terrifying drunk nobody'll ask to leave?  I haven't lost that wager yet.  I didn't specify whose ass, did I?  The ones that finish each other's sentences? Yes I did.  Err... how personal?  Huh, creepy.  Why, anyone with some taste and a lust for adventure.  (sighs. Such an elitist.  Still business to deal with here, don't you think?  Hawke would be there.  We didn't have tea and crumpets, Sparkler. I was there when he woke up.  More like (clear throats "Argh, I'm a darkspawn! Dumat! Dumat!" Then Hawke killed him.  Tell me about it.  So I hear you're kind of the black sheep in your family, Sparkler.  I'm just saying, you and I have... something in common.  Okay, not that much in common.  My mother didn't raise any morons, Sparkler, I won't touch that one.  There's no way I'm answering "which inquisition mage is the best-dressed." Not for all the gold in Orzammar.  So you're not in the magisterium?  But they do pretty much hand out seats like they're candy.  Not if it's with your crazy Tevinter rules.  Wish I hadn't.  Don't go there, Sparkler. Don't wonder if it's useful. Don't even think about it.  Just stay far away, and hope none of it gets to your stupider cousins back home.  You know, I met the Arishok.  I met him too. The only thing they seem to have in common is a tendency to burn things.  So, you're Ben-Hassrath, eh? The spies of the Qunari.  I spent some time in Kirkwall.  You could say that.  You're not the first Ben-Hassrath I've run across. Hawke and I were on a caper with one named Tallis.  She cause us no end of trouble. You wouldn't know her by any chance?  I'm on the Merchant's Guild. Ten royals says I not only know him—he owes me money.  How could you possibly be a spy?  Heh. Where's the sneaking, plotting, the subtle machinations?  Shit. You're really the worst qunari ever, or the best. I can't decide.  I'll see magical dwarves flying through the sky before that happens.  See? And I still can't tell if you're shitting me! Sometimes, you're so Qunari it makes my head hurt.  So, you're a free man, Tal-Vashoth.  I think you finally decided whether you care about your people, or your people.  You made the right choice.  So, qunari in good standing. You must be proud?  I got to see enough of the qunari back in Kirkwall.  No? You could always trust the qunari, until you're between them and something they want.  Yes...?  Among other things...  So, Bull. You and the Inquisitor, huh?  I'd love some impressions. Imagery. Something for my next book.  Safe harbor from the storm outside?  So, Bull. You and Dorian?  "Two worlds tearing them apart, Tevinter and Qunari, with only love to keep them together."  How about passion?  Passion it is, then.  I make up for it elsewhere.  In the world of tall people you find ways to keep them from tripping over you.  If I do, Tiny, you'll be the first to know.  If only I'd had you around to consult.  Bah... where's the drama in that?  Well, thank you. I'm surprised you think so. They're not exactly realistic.  And that didn't bother you?  Impossible swashbuckling it is.  Hey, Tiny, any chance you could get out of the way when I'm trying to shoot?  It should be there next time we head back to base. Not easy to find, by the way.  I don't see what the deal is, honestly, but different tastes...  Hey, what you do with this "cocoa" is up to you. I don't need to hear about it.  Why go with iron? Iron is brittle. Why not call yourself the Steel Bull or something.  Hm... silverite?  (Laughs. So iron was the only thing left.  I've got to ask, what's with qunari and their swords?  Huh. Point taken.  Is the Qun some kind of big secret? How come no qunari I've met would explain it even slightly?  Well, I'll leave them to it then.  Really? Back in Kirkwall you couldn't kick open a crate without finding a jar of the stuff!  Ah, no. We usually just threw it away.  Really?  Well, it is simpler, I give you that.  How could I not?  Hmm... The Iron Bull's belly was prone to rippling after every meal. He rarely wore shirts as they ripped under the strain.  Well, some of them come from Tevinter and some are Ben-Hassrath spies... but I like the stories where the villain was the man beside you the whole time. The best villains don't see themselves as evil. They're fighting for a good cause, willing to get their hands dirty.  I like to leave some things to the reader's imagination.  You doing all right, Bull? I heard you breathing a little hard after the last fight.  Uhuh...  (Laughs. Ouch.  No, no... that was good. I should find some way to work that into my next book.  Certainly. What was it?  Narration, and you can hear how I’m looking?  I will try my best not to do the impossible.  Enjoying the Inquisition so far, Buttercup?  "Shit."  The phrase is commonly “happy as a pig in shit."  No argument there.  You seem the type. Or exactly not the type. I forget how these things are supposed to work sometimes.  And you noticed! That’s why you’re Buttercup.  You’ve seen nobles. You think I’d get any fun hanging out with them?  No argument here.  The whole book?  That's because you do things. Escapist fiction for you would be cross-stitch or knitting.  See, I’d be offended if I didn’t know your “boring” actually means “made of words”.  So what exactly is the deal with the Friends of Red Jenny?  Just... "things." Like... whatever?  Like the, what, the hundred or so groups in Kirkwall, that sat around all night dressed as guards or exotic dancers, waiting to jump out and hit someone?  Seriously, Buttercup, nothing about the way you run things could possibly work.  Well what you do doesn’t make sense.  (sigh Should I push, or am I just setting myself up for  You were in Denerim, huh?  From what I’ve heard, the Jenny thing wasn’t so playful down there.  I’m just saying, it seems like you’re not having the effect you could.  You know, Buttercup, you might get better results from your "friends" if you planned ahead a little.  Nah, I’m more of a pretender, really.  Keep acting like a big shot and hope it sticks. That’s pretty much how the surface dwarf thing works.  Doesn’t matter. Point is, if you put a little more work in, you could pull off much bigger pranks.  Think about it.  So you bagged the silver? Sent letters the first night, then six friends by the river?  That was just the start, Buttercup, a maneuver to increase pressure and reward in a secondary caper.  Causing? No. Harnessing is a better word.  I would say we have indeed made investments that will flower in future dividends.  Yes, but if you plan it right, it doesn't matter. Then you publish.  Quality over quantity.  When did that come up?  I’m pretty sure we were never having this fight, Buttercup.  And probably still aren’t.  Now why would you think I had concerns out that way?  Hypothetically, how many people did that cost?  Buttercup, the kitchen’s missing all their lard. Was that you?  You know, I don’t even want to ask what you did with it. I just want to say…  Nice work.  It’s a crossbow. One of a kind. And far smarter than current company.  We’re a very forgiving family.  You’re eyeing Bianca, Buttercup. She’s taken.  She’s a particular lady, but the rewards more than match the effort.  Someone’s jealous. She has that effect.  Nope. Not going there.  Fair point, Buttercup. Fair point.  It's... complicated.  Dwarven ways are dug in deep. Let's just say I don't quite have the reach. She lacks a certain flexibility.  We're dwarves, so like I said I don't have the... you know, I'll just leave that one to you.  Like it or not, Buttercup, that’s where you come from.  Fair enough. Paragons can be shits too.  Be careful Buttercup. These sorts of romances often don't end well.  You bagged yourself a rare breed, the driver of a story, a protagonist. And a good story. Well, that's about hurting good characters and seeing how they react. I've seen it. And wrote it. A thousand times. Expect some dramatic bumps in the road that's all.  We are adorable.  But still irresistibly cute. It’s my burden to bear.  I'm not used to being so uninvolved in my own conversations. What did I do now?  Look, Buttercup, it's hard to start a new story before you set down the old one.  That was almost a coherent metaphor.  She was very insistent that I help.  What's Interesting?  Wait, you read my book?  Are we still talking about books or are you asking if everyone I know is a secret agent?  A handful, but they're the exception. Mostly they're just honoring the ancestors. It's very dull stuff. Human literature? Now there's where you'll find the tricky, clever, really deceptive types.  Not really. Dwarves write how they want things to be. Humans write to figure out how things are.  So here we are, elf, cleaning up another human mess.  Not you, other elf.  I assume they'd just start burning things.  Now, now, don't get touchy. We're just here to lend you simple humans our help.  Again.  Not my fondest memory, but yes, I did.  Yes. What's on your mind, Chuckles?  Even if we knew, would that help us?  The Wardens couldn't kill him, and they had a thousand years to figure it out.  You really spend most of your time in the Fade?  Sure, but I don't know how you dream, let alone wander around in there.  Especially when the shit that comes out of the Fade generally seems pretty cranky.  You know what I like about you, Chuckles? Your boundless optimism.  No, really. Why else would an elven apostate help crazy Chantry folk close a hole in the sky?  Mostly. We've got the nug market cornered as well.  If they have, they certainly haven't shared anything up here. Why?  The folks back in Orzammar don't care much about anything but tradition.  Nah. Whatever the Stone - capital S - is, it was gone by the time my parents had me.  How could I miss what I never had?  But say I did have that sense, that connection to the Stone. What would it cost me?  Would I lose my friends up here? Would I stop telling stories?  I like who I am. If I want to hear songs, I'll go to a tavern.  What's so confusing about endless darkspawn?  It's hard to get the attention of the humans when the darkspawn aren't up here messing with their stuff.  You're not saying anything I haven't said myself, Chuckles. Orzammar is what it is.  What is it with you, Chuckles? Why do you care so much about the dwarves?  I can think of worse lives.  I suppose it depends on the quality of the fermented fruit juice.  And why is that?  I'd avoid mentioning that to any Carta, Chuckles. They might not take it the right way.  What's with you and the doom stuff? Are you always this cheery or is the hole in the sky getting to you?  All the "fallen empire" crap you go on about. What's so great about empires anyway?  So we lost the Deep Roads, and Orzammar's too proud to ask for help. So what? We're not Orzammar and we're not our empire.  There are tens of thousands of us living up here in the sunlight now, and it's not that bad.  Life goes on. It's just different than it used to be.  I know what it didn't cost me. I'm still here, even after all those thaigs fell.  Ha, you've got it all wrong, Chuckles. This is fighting back.  In that story of yours—-the fisherman watching the stars, dying alone. You thought he gave up, right?  But he went on living. He lost everyone, but he still got up every morning. He made a life, even if it was alone.  That's the world. Everything you build, it tears down. Everything you've got, it takes. And it's gone forever.  The only choices you get are to lie down and die or keep going. He kept going. That's as close to beating the world as anyone gets.  The woman who made Bianca would rather that not happen. Wars are bloody enough as it is.  A crossbow that fires this far and this quickly with so little training? Every battle would be a massacre.  I do all right.  Really? No sarcasm, no superior attitude?  Hey Chuckles, do you ever play Wicked Grace?  You don't have to play for real coin, that's just for keeping score.  Conversation mostly. That way I win no matter how the cards fall.  Qunari too I imagine. They don't care about titles or blood, just stopping the Blight.  Give them some credit, it's not like you can study the Blight safely. I may not like everything they've done, but without the wardens, we'd all be blighted by now.  Did you see the look on those nobles' faces back at the Winter Palace, Chuckles?  Priceless. It's definitely going in my next story.  Close. I need to describe the face someone makes when they choke down something terrible.  I can't wait for Chuckles to say something about the Veil  See? Told you.  Your accent's not Orlesian, Iron Lady. Where are you from originally?  You're a fellow Marcher?  Yeah. Starkhaven is pretty much a collection of howling barbarians.  Unfortunately, yes.  Exactly what he got  Depend. Does a flaming sack of bronto dung count as a gift?  You did? Seriously?  Just how much gold is my publisher stealing from me?  So, Enchanter to the Imperial Court? That's a fancy title.  Why aren't you holed up with the empress in Halamshiral?  Lucky for you, I guess.  You've got to have a few good stories about the court—intrigue, scandal, seductions?  Not even an amusing anecdote? You don't want a chance to bring someone down or boast a little?  No, no, I don't want to bother you.  It's just... I was wondering how you got your nickname  Alright, that's a good one. I'm writing that down for later.  Well, it's just notes right now.  I was planning on a political thriller  Actually, (nervous laugh, you're the villain.  Alright, how much trouble am I in for this book?  For the villain thing?  Seriously?  You're the scheming duchess, coldly maneuvering her political rivals into a trap.  I'm... going to spend the next few weeks researching Orlesian gowns, aren't I?  Well, the first one will come out in twelve chapters.  I've read enough Orlesian fictions to know you never tell a story there in fewer than three complete books. They think you're just warming up after one.  Are you asking for spoilers, Madame De Fer?  You still want "hints" on how my unfinished serial will turn out?  I already gave you a big one, Iron Lady.  Really! If the book is a trilogy, what are the odds the villain can be defeated in book one?  You know, we're so far into spoiler territory right now, I think I better stop talking.  Not on your life, Iron Lady. The best way to ensure a book's nevered finish is to tell someone your entire plot.  Nobody told me there is a cutoff. Besides, Iron Lady, you're no poorer than me.  I don't know. "Not being killed by rampaging demons" seems to be as good as gold to me.  I have a serious question for you, Iron Lady.  In the Imperial Court, if someone use the wrong fork at dinner, is that worse than death or just social suicide?  Let's be fair, I live like a rich peasant.  I wish! These days it's all outposts and marching.  Look, all those things you like about nobility? Power, wealth, notoriety? Those are the things I hate about it.  Just wait until you meet my friends.  Why? I don't think he makes anything in your size.  No, it's more of a personal decision.  I don't like seeing them explode and destroy cities. Faith's not really a big factor there.  What? You never told me that!  That our former Divine kidnapped and brutalized her favorite authors? Oh, yes. (laughs Thrilled!  There are times I almost understand the two of you.  Who doesn't already know, that is.  (if in party Not hardly enough, if you ask me.  (if in party Leaves?  Ouch!
